Most attendees gained\\\\r\\\\nmuch in insight and outlook from the event.  But the assembly did not\\\\r\\\\nform a new nation, or, to put it another way, the diversity of projects\\\\r\\\\nand interests was too great to draw the representatives into a cohesive,\\\\r\\\\naction-oriented body.(2)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEveryone attending the Workshop shared an interest in preserving and\\\\r\\\\nproviding access to historical texts.  But within this broad field the\\\\r\\\\nattendees represented a variety of formal, informal, figurative, and\\\\r\\\\nliteral groups, with many individuals belonging to more than one.  These\\\\r\\\\ngroups may be defined roughly according to the following topics or\\\\r\\\\nactivities:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* Imaging\\\\r\\\\n* Searchable coded texts\\\\r\\\\n* National and international computer networks\\\\r\\\\n* CD-ROM production and dissemination\\\\r\\\\n* Methods and technology for converting older paper materials into\\\\r\\\\nelectronic form\\\\r\\\\n* Study of the use of digital materials by scholars and others\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis summary is arranged thematically and does not follow the actual\\\\r\\\\nsequence of presentations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNOTES:\\\\r\\\\n     (1)  In this document, the phrase electronic text is used to mean\\\\r\\\\n     any computerized reproduction or version of a document, book,\\\\r\\\\n     article, or manuscript (including images), and not merely a machine-\\\\r\\\\n     readable or machine-searchable text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     (2)  The Workshop was held at the Library of Congress on 9-10 June\\\\r\\\\n     1992, with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.\\\\r\\\\n     The document that follows represents a summary of the presentations\\\\r\\\\n     made at the Workshop and was compiled by James DALY.  This\\\\r\\\\n     introduction was written by DALY and Carl FLEISCHHAUER.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPRESERVATION AND IMAGING\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPreservation, as that term is used by archivists,(3) was most explicitly\\\\r\\\\ndiscussed in the context of imaging.  Anne KENNEY and Lynne PERSONIUS\\\\r\\\\nexplained how the concept of a faithful copy and the user-friendliness of\\\\r\\\\nthe traditional book have guided their project at Cornell University.(4)\\\\r\\\\nAlthough interested in computerized dissemination, participants in the\\\\r\\\\nCornell project are creating digital image sets of older books in the\\\\r\\\\npublic domain as a source for a fresh paper facsimile or, in a future\\\\r\\\\nphase, microfilm.  The books returned to the library shelves are\\\\r\\\\nhigh-quality and useful replacements on acid-free paper that should last\\\\r\\\\na long time.  To date, the Cornell project has placed little or no\\\\r\\\\nemphasis on creating searchable texts; one would not be surprised to find\\\\r\\\\nthat the project participants view such texts as new editions, and thus\\\\r\\\\nnot as faithful reproductions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn her talk on preservation, Patricia BATTIN struck an ecumenical and\\\\r\\\\nflexible note as she endorsed the creation and dissemination of a variety\\\\r\\\\nof types of digital copies.  Do not be too narrow in defining what counts\\\\r\\\\nas a preservation element, BATTIN counseled; for the present, at least,\\\\r\\\\ndigital copies made with preservation in mind cannot be as narrowly\\\\r\\\\nstandardized as, say, microfilm copies with the same objective.  Setting\\\\r\\\\nstandards precipitously can inhibit creativity, but delay can result in\\\\r\\\\nchaos, she advised.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn part, BATTIN\\\\\\'s position reflected the unsettled nature of image-format\\\\r\\\\nstandards, and attendees could hear echoes of this unsettledness in the\\\\r\\\\ncomments of various speakers.  For example, Jean BARONAS reviewed the\\\\r\\\\nstatus of several formal standards moving through committees of experts;\\\\r\\\\nand Clifford LYNCH encouraged the use of a new guideline for transmitting\\\\r\\\\ndocument images on Internet.  Testimony from participants in the National\\\\r\\\\nAgricultural Library\\\\\\'s (NAL) Text Digitization Program and LC\\\\\\'s American\\\\r\\\\nMemory project highlighted some of the challenges to the actual creation\\\\r\\\\nor interchange of images, including difficulties in converting\\\\r\\\\npreservation microfilm to digital form.  Donald WATERS reported on the\\\\r\\\\nprogress of a master plan for a project at Yale University to convert\\\\r\\\\nbooks on microfilm to digital image sets, Project Open Book (POB).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Workshop offered rather less of an imaging practicum than planned,\\\\r\\\\nbut \"how-to\" hints emerge at various points, for example, throughout\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY\\\\\\'s presentation and in the discussion of arcana such as\\\\r\\\\nthresholding and dithering offered by George THOMA and FLEISCHHAUER.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNOTES:\\\\r\\\\n     (3)  Although there is a sense in which any reproductions of\\\\r\\\\n     historical materials preserve the human record, specialists in the\\\\r\\\\n     field have developed particular guidelines for the creation of\\\\r\\\\n     acceptable preservation copies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     (4)  Titles and affiliations of presenters are given at the\\\\r\\\\n     beginning of their respective talks and in the Directory of\\\\r\\\\n     Participants (Appendix III).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE MACHINE-READABLE TEXT:  MARKUP AND USE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe sections of the Workshop that dealt with machine-readable text tended\\\\r\\\\nto be more concerned with access and use than with preservation, at least\\\\r\\\\nin the narrow technical sense.  Michael SPERBERG-McQUEEN made a forceful\\\\r\\\\npresentation on the Text Encoding Initiative\\\\\\'s (TEI) implementation of\\\\r\\\\nthe Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  His ideas were echoed\\\\r\\\\nby Susan HOCKEY, Elli MYLONAS, and Stuart WEIBEL.  While the\\\\r\\\\npresentations made by the TEI advocates contained no practicum, their\\\\r\\\\ndiscussion focused on the value of the finished product, what the\\\\r\\\\nEuropean Community calls reusability, but what may also be termed\\\\r\\\\ndurability.  They argued that marking up--that is, coding--a text in a\\\\r\\\\nwell-conceived way will permit it to be moved from one computer\\\\r\\\\nenvironment to another, as well as to be used by various users.  Two\\\\r\\\\nkinds of markup were distinguished:  1) procedural markup, which\\\\r\\\\ndescribes the features of a text (e.g., dots on a page), and 2)\\\\r\\\\ndescriptive markup, which describes the structure or elements of a\\\\r\\\\ndocument (e.g., chapters, paragraphs, and front matter).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI proponents emphasized the importance of texts to scholarship.\\\\r\\\\nThey explained how heavily coded (and thus analyzed and annotated) texts\\\\r\\\\ncan underlie research, play a role in scholarly communication, and\\\\r\\\\nfacilitate classroom teaching.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN reminded listeners that\\\\r\\\\na written or printed item (e.g., a particular edition of a book) is\\\\r\\\\nmerely a representation of the abstraction we call a text.  To concern\\\\r\\\\nourselves with faithfully reproducing a printed instance of the text,\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN argued, is to concern ourselves with the representation\\\\r\\\\nof a representation (\"images as simulacra for the text\").  The TEI proponents\\\\\\'\\\\r\\\\ninterest in images tends to focus on corollary materials for use in teaching,\\\\r\\\\nfor example, photographs of the Acropolis to accompany a Greek text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the end of the Workshop, SPERBERG-McQUEEN confessed to having been\\\\r\\\\nconverted to a limited extent to the view that electronic images\\\\r\\\\nconstitute a promising alternative to microfilming; indeed, an\\\\r\\\\nalternative probably superior to microfilming.  But he was not convinced\\\\r\\\\nthat electronic images constitute a serious attempt to represent text in\\\\r\\\\nelectronic form.  HOCKEY and MYLONAS also conceded that their experience\\\\r\\\\nat the Pierce Symposium the previous week at Georgetown University and\\\\r\\\\nthe present conference at the Library of Congress had compelled them to\\\\r\\\\nreevaluate their perspective on the usefulness of text as images.\\\\r\\\\nAttendees could see that the text and image advocates were in\\\\r\\\\nconstructive tension, so to say.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree nonTEI presentations described approaches to preparing\\\\r\\\\nmachine-readable text that are less rigorous and thus less expensive.  In\\\\r\\\\nthe case of the Papers of George Washington, Dorothy TWOHIG explained\\\\r\\\\nthat the digital version will provide a not-quite-perfect rendering of\\\\r\\\\nthe transcribed text--some 135,000 documents, available for research\\\\r\\\\nduring the decades while the perfect or print version is completed.\\\\r\\\\nMembers of the American Memory team and the staff of NAL\\\\\\'s Text\\\\r\\\\nDigitization Program (see below) also outlined a middle ground concerning\\\\r\\\\nsearchable texts.  In the case of American Memory, contractors produce\\\\r\\\\ntexts with about 99-percent accuracy that serve as \"browse\" or\\\\r\\\\n\"reference\" versions of written or printed originals.  End users who need\\\\r\\\\nfaithful copies or perfect renditions must refer to accompanying sets of\\\\r\\\\ndigital facsimile images or consult copies of the originals in a nearby\\\\r\\\\nlibrary or archive.  American Memory staff argued that the high cost of\\\\r\\\\nproducing 100-percent accurate copies would prevent LC from offering\\\\r\\\\naccess to large parts of its collections.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHE MACHINE-READABLE TEXT:  METHODS OF CONVERSION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlthough the Workshop did not include a systematic examination of the\\\\r\\\\nmethods for converting texts from paper (or from facsimile images) into\\\\r\\\\nmachine-readable form, nevertheless, various speakers touched upon this\\\\r\\\\nmatter.  For example, WEIBEL reported that OCLC has experimented with a\\\\r\\\\nmerging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will\\\\r\\\\nreduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 5 characters out of every\\\\r\\\\nl,000 to an unacceptable rate of 2 characters out of every l,000.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPamela ANDRE presented an overview of NAL\\\\\\'s Text Digitization Program and\\\\r\\\\nJudith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  ZIDAR explained how NAL\\\\r\\\\npurchased hardware and software capable of performing optical character\\\\r\\\\nrecognition (OCR) and text conversion and used its own staff to convert\\\\r\\\\ntexts.  The process, ZIDAR said, required extensive editing and project\\\\r\\\\nstaff found themselves considering alternatives, including rekeying\\\\r\\\\nand/or creating abstracts or summaries of texts.  NAL reckoned costs at\\\\r\\\\n$7 per page.  By way of contrast, Ricky ERWAY explained that American\\\\r\\\\nMemory had decided from the start to contract out conversion to external\\\\r\\\\nservice bureaus.  The criteria used to select these contractors were cost\\\\r\\\\nand quality of results, as opposed to methods of conversion.  ERWAY noted\\\\r\\\\nthat historical documents or books often do not lend themselves to OCR.\\\\r\\\\nBound materials represent a special problem.  In her experience, quality\\\\r\\\\ncontrol--inspecting incoming materials, counting errors in samples--posed\\\\r\\\\nthe most time-consuming aspect of contracting out conversion.  ERWAY\\\\r\\\\nreckoned American Memory\\\\\\'s costs at $4 per page, but cautioned that fewer\\\\r\\\\ncost-elements had been included than in NAL\\\\\\'s figure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOPTIONS FOR DISSEMINATION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe topic of dissemination proper emerged at various points during the\\\\r\\\\nWorkshop.  At the session devoted to national and international computer\\\\r\\\\nnetworks, LYNCH, Howard BESSER, Ronald LARSEN, and Edwin BROWNRIGG\\\\r\\\\nhighlighted the virtues of Internet today and of the network that will\\\\r\\\\nevolve from Internet.  Listeners could discern in these narratives a\\\\r\\\\nvision of an information democracy in which millions of citizens freely\\\\r\\\\nfind and use what they need.  LYNCH noted that a lack of standards\\\\r\\\\ninhibits disseminating multimedia on the network, a topic also discussed\\\\r\\\\nby BESSER.  LARSEN addressed the issues of network scalability and\\\\r\\\\nmodularity and commented upon the difficulty of anticipating the effects\\\\r\\\\nof growth in orders of magnitude.  BROWNRIGG talked about the ability of\\\\r\\\\npacket radio to provide certain links in a network without the need for\\\\r\\\\nwiring.  However, the presenters also called attention to the\\\\r\\\\nshortcomings and incongruities of present-day computer networks.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample:  1) Network use is growing dramatically, but much network\\\\r\\\\ntraffic consists of personal communication (E-mail).  2) Large bodies of\\\\r\\\\ninformation are available, but a user\\\\\\'s ability to search across their\\\\r\\\\nentirety is limited.  3) There are significant resources for science and\\\\r\\\\ntechnology, but few network sources provide content in the humanities.\\\\r\\\\n4) Machine-readable texts are commonplace, but the capability of the\\\\r\\\\nsystem to deal with images (let alone other media formats) lags behind.\\\\r\\\\nA glimpse of a multimedia future for networks, however, was provided by\\\\r\\\\nMaria LEBRON in her overview of the Online Journal of Current Clinical\\\\r\\\\nTrials (OJCCT), and the process of scholarly publishing on-line.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe contrasting form of the CD-ROM disk was never systematically\\\\r\\\\nanalyzed, but attendees could glean an impression from several of the\\\\r\\\\nshow-and-tell presentations.  The Perseus and American Memory examples\\\\r\\\\ndemonstrated recently published disks, while the descriptions of the\\\\r\\\\nIBYCUS version of the Papers of George Washington and Chadwyck-Healey\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nPatrologia Latina Database (PLD) told of disks to come.  According to\\\\r\\\\nEric CALALUCA, PLD\\\\\\'s principal focus has been on converting Jacques-Paul\\\\r\\\\nMigne\\\\\\'s definitive collection of Latin texts to machine-readable form.\\\\r\\\\nAlthough everyone could share the network advocates\\\\\\' enthusiasm for an\\\\r\\\\non-line future, the possibility of rolling up one\\\\\\'s sleeves for a session\\\\r\\\\nwith a CD-ROM containing both textual materials and a powerful retrieval\\\\r\\\\nengine made the disk seem an appealing vessel indeed.  The overall\\\\r\\\\ndiscussion suggested that the transition from CD-ROM to on-line networked\\\\r\\\\naccess may prove far slower and more difficult than has been anticipated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWHO ARE THE USERS AND WHAT DO THEY DO?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlthough concerned with the technicalities of production, the Workshop\\\\r\\\\nnever lost sight of the purposes and uses of electronic versions of\\\\r\\\\ntextual materials.  As noted above, those interested in imaging discussed\\\\r\\\\nthe problematical matter of digital preservation, while the TEI proponents\\\\r\\\\ndescribed how machine-readable texts can be used in research.  This latter\\\\r\\\\ntopic received thorough treatment in the paper read by Avra MICHELSON.\\\\r\\\\nShe placed the phenomenon of electronic texts within the context of\\\\r\\\\nbroader trends in information technology and scholarly communication.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong other things, MICHELSON described on-line conferences that\\\\r\\\\nrepresent a vigorous and important intellectual forum for certain\\\\r\\\\ndisciplines.  Internet now carries more than 700 conferences, with about\\\\r\\\\n80 percent of these devoted to topics in the social sciences and the\\\\r\\\\nhumanities.  Other scholars use on-line networks for \"distance learning.\"\\\\r\\\\nMeanwhile, there has been a tremendous growth in end-user computing;\\\\r\\\\nprofessors today are less likely than their predecessors to ask the\\\\r\\\\ncampus computer center to process their data.  Electronic texts are one\\\\r\\\\nkey to these sophisticated applications, MICHELSON reported, and more and\\\\r\\\\nmore scholars in the humanities now work in an on-line environment.\\\\r\\\\nToward the end of the Workshop, Michael LESK presented a corollary to\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON\\\\\\'s talk, reporting the results of an experiment that compared\\\\r\\\\nthe work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed\\\\r\\\\ntexts and two groups using electronic sources.  The experiment\\\\r\\\\ndemonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read, one needs\\\\r\\\\nthe electronic systems; the electronic systems hold no advantage at the\\\\r\\\\nmoment if one knows what to read, but neither do they impose a penalty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the\\\\r\\\\nnew technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics.\\\\r\\\\nHis account, by extrapolation, served to illustrate in part the arguments\\\\r\\\\nmade by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical\\\\r\\\\ntransformation being wrought in the ways scholars work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSusan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic\\\\r\\\\nmaterials outside the university.  The most interesting aspect of their\\\\r\\\\nuse, FREEMAN said, could be seen as a paradox:  teachers in elementary\\\\r\\\\nand secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but,\\\\r\\\\nat the same time, found that \"primariness\" itself made these materials\\\\r\\\\ndifficult for their students to use.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOTHER TOPICS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMarybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered\\\\r\\\\nadvice during a lively discussion of this subject.  But uncertainty\\\\r\\\\nremains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium, because a\\\\r\\\\nsolution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of\\\\r\\\\ncopyrighted and out-of-copyright pieces of a database.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs moderator of the final session of the Workshop, Prosser GIFFORD directed\\\\r\\\\ndiscussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in\\\\r\\\\nadvancing them.  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Workshop participants should 1) begin to think about working\\\\r\\\\n     with image material, but structure and digitize it in such a\\\\r\\\\n     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text, and\\\\r\\\\n     2) find a common way to build text and images together so that\\\\r\\\\n     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future, with\\\\r\\\\n     appropriate network support, because that is how users will want\\\\r\\\\n     to access these materials.  The Library might encourage attempts\\\\r\\\\n     to bring together people who are working on texts and images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * A network version of American Memory should be developed or\\\\r\\\\n     consideration should be given to making the data in it\\\\r\\\\n     available to people interested in doing network multimedia.\\\\r\\\\n     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and\\\\r\\\\n     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems, developing a\\\\r\\\\n     network version of American Memory could do much to help make\\\\r\\\\n     network multimedia a reality.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit, LC should\\\\r\\\\n     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed\\\\r\\\\n     responsibility, that is, bring together the distributed\\\\r\\\\n     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the\\\\r\\\\n     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a\\\\r\\\\n     nation should move.  For example, LC might attempt to persuade\\\\r\\\\n     one major library in each state to deal with its state\\\\r\\\\n     equivalent publisher, which might produce a cooperative project\\\\r\\\\n     that would be equitably distributed around the country, and one\\\\r\\\\n     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers\\\\r\\\\n     and minimal copyright problems.  LC must also deal with the\\\\r\\\\n     concept of on-line publishing, determining, among other things,\\\\r\\\\n     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Since a number of projects are planning to carry out\\\\r\\\\n     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in\\\\r\\\\n     on-line or near-line storage at some institution, LC might play\\\\r\\\\n     a helpful role, at least in the near term, by accelerating how\\\\r\\\\n     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information\\\\r\\\\n     Network (RLIN) and then into OCLC, so that it would be accessible.\\\\r\\\\n     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing\\\\r\\\\n     the same work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCONCLUSION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from\\\\r\\\\nvarious groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods.\\\\r\\\\nThe more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their\\\\r\\\\ngroups, but less often across group boundaries.  The Workshop was also\\\\r\\\\nvaluable to attendees--including those involved with American Memory--who\\\\r\\\\ncame less committed to particular approaches or concepts.  These\\\\r\\\\nattendees learned a great deal, and plan to select and employ elements of\\\\r\\\\nimaging, text-coding, and networked distribution that suit their\\\\r\\\\nrespective projects and purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStill, reality rears its ugly head:  no breakthrough has been achieved.\\\\r\\\\nOn the imaging side, one confronts a proliferation of competing\\\\r\\\\ndata-interchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital\\\\r\\\\nfacsimiles in preservation.  In the realm of machine-readable texts, one\\\\r\\\\nencounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties\\\\r\\\\nand high costs.  These latter problems, of course, represent a special\\\\r\\\\nimpediment to the desire, as it is sometimes expressed in the popular\\\\r\\\\npress, \"to put the [contents of the] Library of Congress on line.\"  In\\\\r\\\\nthe words of one participant, there was \"no solution to the economic\\\\r\\\\nproblems--the projects that are out there are surviving, but it is going\\\\r\\\\nto be a lot of work to transform the information industry, and so far the\\\\r\\\\ninvestment to do that is not forthcoming\" (LESK, per litteras).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n               ***   ***   ***   ******   ***   ***   ***\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                               PROCEEDINGS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWELCOME\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nGIFFORD * Origin of Workshop in current Librarian\\\\\\'s desire to make LC\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\ncollections more widely available * Desiderata arising from the prospect\\\\r\\\\nof greater interconnectedness *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress,\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Memory (AM), and the National Demonstration Lab, Prosser\\\\r\\\\nGIFFORD, director for scholarly programs, Library of Congress, located\\\\r\\\\nthe origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had\\\\r\\\\nhad considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning\\\\r\\\\nsome of the issues faced by AM.  On the assumption that numerous other\\\\r\\\\npeople were asking the same questions, the decision was made to bring\\\\r\\\\ntogether as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions\\\\r\\\\ntogether.  In a deeper sense, GIFFORD said, the origin of the Workshop\\\\r\\\\nlay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress, James H.\\\\r\\\\nBillington, to make the collections of the Library, especially those\\\\r\\\\noffering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American\\\\r\\\\nexperience, available to a much wider circle of users than those few\\\\r\\\\npeople who can come to Washington to use them.  This meant that the\\\\r\\\\nemphasis of AM, from the outset, has been on archival collections of the\\\\r\\\\nbasic material, and on making these collections themselves available,\\\\r\\\\nrather than selected or heavily edited products.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom AM\\\\\\'s emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began:\\\\r\\\\nwho will use these materials, and in what form will they wish to use\\\\r\\\\nthem.  But an even larger issue deserving mention, in GIFFORD\\\\\\'s view, was\\\\r\\\\nthe phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity.  He expressed the hope\\\\r\\\\nthat the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would\\\\r\\\\nlead to:  1) much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors; 2)\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to\\\\r\\\\navoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique\\\\r\\\\nmaterials; and 3) agreement on the necessary standards and development of\\\\r\\\\nthe appropriate directories and indices to make navigation\\\\r\\\\nstraightforward among the varied resources that are, and increasingly\\\\r\\\\nwill be, available.  In this connection, GIFFORD requested that\\\\r\\\\nparticipants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they\\\\r\\\\nthought the Workshop might have.  Did those present constitute a group\\\\r\\\\nwith sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps,\\\\r\\\\nand if so, what might those be?  They would return to these questions the\\\\r\\\\nfollowing afternoon.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER * Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of\\\\r\\\\nmaterials * Special challenge in conversion of textual materials *\\\\r\\\\nQuality versus quantity * Do the several groups represented share common\\\\r\\\\ninterests? *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarl FLEISCHHAUER, coordinator, American Memory, Library of Congress,\\\\r\\\\nemphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some\\\\r\\\\nof the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of\\\\r\\\\nthe Workshop had to do with preparation and production.  FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\nthen drew a distinction between the long term, when many things would be\\\\r\\\\navailable and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described, and the short\\\\r\\\\nterm, in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the\\\\r\\\\nbest course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical\\\\r\\\\nchallenges.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER remarked AM\\\\\\'s endeavors to deal with a wide range of library\\\\r\\\\nformats, such as motion picture collections, sound-recording collections,\\\\r\\\\nand pictorial collections of various sorts, especially collections of\\\\r\\\\nphotographs.  In the course of these efforts, AM kept coming back to\\\\r\\\\ntextual materials--manuscripts or rare printed matter, bound materials,\\\\r\\\\netc.  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all.  Thus, the\\\\r\\\\ngenesis of the Workshop, which reflects the problems faced by AM.  These\\\\r\\\\nproblems include physical problems.  For example, those in the library\\\\r\\\\nand archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare\\\\r\\\\nmanuscript items, bound materials, especially the notoriously brittle\\\\r\\\\nbound materials of the late nineteenth century.  These are precious\\\\r\\\\ncultural artifacts, however, as well as interesting sources of\\\\r\\\\ninformation, and LC desires to retain and conserve them.  AM needs to\\\\r\\\\nhandle things without damaging them.  Guillotining a book to run it\\\\r\\\\nthrough a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBeyond physical problems, issues pertaining to quality arose.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample, the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected\\\\r\\\\nby the question of acceptable level of accuracy.  One hundred percent\\\\r\\\\naccuracy is tremendously expensive.  On the other hand, the output of\\\\r\\\\noptical character recognition (OCR) can be tremendously inaccurate.\\\\r\\\\nAlthough AM has attempted to find a middle ground, uncertainty persists\\\\r\\\\nas to whether or not it has discovered the right solution.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nQuestions of quality arose concerning images as well.  FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\ncontrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in\\\\r\\\\nthe Cornell Xerox Project with AM\\\\\\'s efforts to provide a browse-quality\\\\r\\\\nor access-quality image, as opposed to an archival or preservation image.\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about\\\\r\\\\nnetworks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a\\\\r\\\\ndetermination may be made that there is a browse-quality item, or a\\\\r\\\\ndistribution-and-access-quality item that may coexist in some systems\\\\r\\\\nwith a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send\\\\r\\\\nthrough the network because of its size.  FLEISCHHAUER referred, of\\\\r\\\\ncourse, to images more than to searchable text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs AM considered those questions, several conceptual issues arose:  ought\\\\r\\\\nAM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set, at\\\\r\\\\nother times, entirely through a text set, and in some cases, a mix?\\\\r\\\\nThere probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an\\\\r\\\\nartifact would require that its image be used.  An image might be\\\\r\\\\ndesirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide 100-percent\\\\r\\\\naccurate text.  Again, AM wondered, as a practical matter, if a\\\\r\\\\ndistinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist\\\\r\\\\nin multiple collections--that is, in ten or fifteen libraries.  In such\\\\r\\\\ncases, the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique\\\\r\\\\nitems.  Implicit in his remarks, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, was the admission\\\\r\\\\nthat AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a\\\\r\\\\nlittle from perfect quality.  That is, it seemed to AM that society would\\\\r\\\\nbe better served if more things were distributed by LC--even if they were\\\\r\\\\nnot quite perfect--than if fewer things, perfectly represented, were\\\\r\\\\ndistributed.  This was stated as a proposition to be tested, with\\\\r\\\\nresponses to be gathered from users.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing\\\\r\\\\nother people engaged in parallel activities, AM deemed it useful to\\\\r\\\\nconvene a conference.  Hence, the Workshop.  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon\\\\r\\\\nsurveyed the several groups represented:  1) the world of images (image\\\\r\\\\nusers and image makers); 2) the world of text and scholarship and, within\\\\r\\\\nthis group, those concerned with language--FLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding\\\\r\\\\ndelightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on\\\\r\\\\ncomputerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials;\\\\r\\\\n3) the network world; and 4) the general world of library science, which\\\\r\\\\nincludes people interested in preservation and cataloging.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and\\\\r\\\\nLucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting, the American\\\\r\\\\nMemory group, the Office for Scholarly Programs, the National\\\\r\\\\nDemonstration Lab, and the Office of Special Events.  He expressed the\\\\r\\\\nhope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend, noting that\\\\r\\\\nPackard\\\\\\'s work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of\\\\r\\\\nprojects in the text area.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION I.  CONTENT IN A NEW FORM:   WHO WILL USE IT AND WHAT WILL THEY DO?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDALY * Acknowledgements * A new Latin authors disk *  Effects of the new\\\\r\\\\ntechnology on previous methods of research *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nServing as moderator, James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the\\\\r\\\\npresenters for giving of their time, counsel, and patience in planning\\\\r\\\\nthe Workshop, as well as of members of the American Memory project and\\\\r\\\\nother Library of Congress staff, and the David and Lucile Packard\\\\r\\\\nFoundation and its executive director, Colburn S. Wilbur.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDALY then recounted his visit in March to the Center for Electronic Texts\\\\r\\\\nin the Humanities (CETH) and the Department of Classics at Rutgers\\\\r\\\\nUniversity, where an old friend, Lowell Edmunds, introduced him to the\\\\r\\\\ndepartment\\\\\\'s IBYCUS scholarly personal computer, and, in particular, the\\\\r\\\\nnew Latin CD-ROM, containing, among other things, almost all classical\\\\r\\\\nLatin literary texts through A.D. 200.  Packard Humanities Institute\\\\r\\\\n(PHI), Los Altos, California, released this disk late in 1991, with a\\\\r\\\\nnominal triennial licensing fee.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlaying with the disk for an hour or so at Rutgers brought home to DALY\\\\r\\\\nat once the revolutionizing impact of the new technology on his previous\\\\r\\\\nmethods of research.  Had this disk been available two or three years\\\\r\\\\nearlier, DALY contended, when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on\\\\r\\\\nBook 10 of Virgil\\\\\\'s Aeneid for Cambridge University Press, he would not\\\\r\\\\nhave required a forty-eight-square-foot table on which to spread the\\\\r\\\\nnumerous, most frequently consulted items, including some ten or twelve\\\\r\\\\nconcordances to key Latin authors, an almost equal number of lexica to\\\\r\\\\nauthors who lacked concordances, and where either lexica or concordances\\\\r\\\\nwere lacking, numerous editions of authors antedating and postdating Virgil.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNor, when checking each of the average six to seven words contained in\\\\r\\\\nthe Virgilian hexameter for its usage elsewhere in Virgil\\\\\\'s works or\\\\r\\\\nother Latin authors, would DALY have had to maintain the laborious\\\\r\\\\nmechanical process of flipping through these concordances, lexica, and\\\\r\\\\neditions each time.  Nor would he have had to frequent as often the\\\\r\\\\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University to consult\\\\r\\\\nthe Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.  Instead of devoting countless hours, or\\\\r\\\\nthe bulk of his research time, to gathering data concerning Virgil\\\\\\'s use\\\\r\\\\nof words, DALY--now freed by PHI\\\\\\'s Latin authors disk from the\\\\r\\\\ntyrannical, yet in some ways paradoxically happy scholarly drudgery--\\\\r\\\\nwould have been able to devote that same bulk of time to analyzing and\\\\r\\\\ninterpreting Virgilian verbal usage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCiting Theodore Brunner, Gregory Crane, Elli MYLONAS, and Avra MICHELSON,\\\\r\\\\nDALY argued that this reversal in his style of work, made possible by the\\\\r\\\\nnew technology, would perhaps have resulted in better, more productive\\\\r\\\\nresearch.  Indeed, even in the course of his browsing the Latin authors\\\\r\\\\ndisk at Rutgers, its powerful search, retrieval, and highlighting\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities suggested to him several new avenues of research into\\\\r\\\\nVirgil\\\\\\'s use of sound effects.  This anecdotal account, DALY maintained,\\\\r\\\\nmay serve to illustrate in part the sudden and radical transformation\\\\r\\\\nbeing wrought in the ways scholars work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON * Elements related to scholarship and technology * Electronic\\\\r\\\\ntexts within the context of broader trends within information technology\\\\r\\\\nand scholarly communication * Evaluation of the prospects for the use of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic texts * Relationship of electronic texts to processes of\\\\r\\\\nscholarly communication in humanities research * New exchange formats\\\\r\\\\ncreated by scholars * Projects initiated to increase scholarly access to\\\\r\\\\nconverted text * Trend toward making electronic resources available\\\\r\\\\nthrough research and education networks * Changes taking place in\\\\r\\\\nscholarly communication among humanities scholars * Network-mediated\\\\r\\\\nscholarship transforming traditional scholarly practices * Key\\\\r\\\\ninformation technology trends affecting the conduct of scholarly\\\\r\\\\ncommunication over the next decade * The trend toward end-user computing\\\\r\\\\n* The trend toward greater connectivity * Effects of these trends * Key\\\\r\\\\ntransformations taking place * Summary of principal arguments *\\\\r\\\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAvra MICHELSON, Archival Research and Evaluation Staff, National Archives\\\\r\\\\nand Records Administration (NARA), argued that establishing who will use\\\\r\\\\nelectronic texts and what they will use them for involves a consideration\\\\r\\\\nof both information technology and scholarship trends.  This\\\\r\\\\nconsideration includes several elements related to scholarship and\\\\r\\\\ntechnology:  1) the key trends in information technology that are most\\\\r\\\\nrelevant to scholarship; 2) the key trends in the use of currently\\\\r\\\\navailable technology by scholars in the nonscientific community; and 3)\\\\r\\\\nthe relationship between these two very distinct but interrelated trends.\\\\r\\\\nThe investment in understanding this relationship being made by\\\\r\\\\ninformation providers, technologists, and public policy developers, as\\\\r\\\\nwell as by scholars themselves, seems to be pervasive and growing,\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON contended.  She drew on collaborative work with Jeff Rothenberg\\\\r\\\\non the scholarly use of technology.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON sought to place the phenomenon of electronic texts within the\\\\r\\\\ncontext of broader trends within information technology and scholarly\\\\r\\\\ncommunication.  She argued that electronic texts are of most use to\\\\r\\\\nresearchers to the extent that the researchers\\\\\\' working context (i.e.,\\\\r\\\\ntheir relevant bibliographic sources, collegial feedback, analytic tools,\\\\r\\\\nnotes, drafts, etc.), along with their field\\\\\\'s primary and secondary\\\\r\\\\nsources, also is accessible in electronic form and can be integrated in\\\\r\\\\nways that are unique to the on-line environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEvaluation of the prospects for the use of electronic texts includes two\\\\r\\\\nelements:  1) an examination of the ways in which researchers currently\\\\r\\\\nare using electronic texts along with other electronic resources, and 2)\\\\r\\\\nan analysis of key information technology trends that are affecting the\\\\r\\\\nlong-term conduct of scholarly communication.  MICHELSON limited her\\\\r\\\\ndiscussion of the use of electronic texts to the practices of humanists\\\\r\\\\nand noted that the scientific community was outside the panel\\\\\\'s overview.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON examined the nature of the current relationship of electronic\\\\r\\\\ntexts in particular, and electronic resources in general, to what she\\\\r\\\\nmaintained were, essentially, five processes of scholarly communication\\\\r\\\\nin humanities research.  Researchers 1) identify sources, 2) communicate\\\\r\\\\nwith their colleagues, 3) interpret and analyze data, 4) disseminate\\\\r\\\\ntheir research findings, and 5) prepare curricula to instruct the next\\\\r\\\\ngeneration of scholars and students.  This examination would produce a\\\\r\\\\nclearer understanding of the synergy among these five processes that\\\\r\\\\nfuels the tendency of the use of electronic resources for one process to\\\\r\\\\nstimulate its use for other processes of scholarly communication.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor the first process of scholarly communication, the identification of\\\\r\\\\nsources, MICHELSON remarked the opportunity scholars now enjoy to\\\\r\\\\nsupplement traditional word-of-mouth searches for sources among their\\\\r\\\\ncolleagues with new forms of electronic searching.  So, for example,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of having to visit the library, researchers are able to explore\\\\r\\\\ndescriptions of holdings in their offices.  Furthermore, if their own\\\\r\\\\ninstitutions\\\\\\' holdings prove insufficient, scholars can access more than\\\\r\\\\n200 major American library catalogues over Internet, including the\\\\r\\\\nuniversities of California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\\\\r\\\\nDirect access to the bibliographic databases offers intellectual\\\\r\\\\nempowerment to scholars by presenting a comprehensive means of browsing\\\\r\\\\nthrough libraries from their homes and offices at their convenience.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe second process of communication involves communication among\\\\r\\\\nscholars.  Beyond the most common methods of communication, scholars are\\\\r\\\\nusing E-mail and a variety of new electronic communications formats\\\\r\\\\nderived from it for further academic interchange.  E-mail exchanges are\\\\r\\\\ngrowing at an astonishing rate, reportedly 15 percent a month.  They\\\\r\\\\ncurrently constitute approximately half the traffic on research and\\\\r\\\\neducation networks.  Moreover, the global spread of E-mail has been so\\\\r\\\\nrapid that it is now possible for American scholars to use it to\\\\r\\\\ncommunicate with colleagues in close to 140 other countries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther new exchange formats created by scholars and operating on Internet\\\\r\\\\ninclude more than 700 conferences, with about 80 percent of these devoted\\\\r\\\\nto topics in the social sciences and humanities.  The rate of growth of\\\\r\\\\nthese scholarly electronic conferences also is astonishing.  From l990 to\\\\r\\\\nl991, 200 new conferences were identified on Internet.  From October 1991\\\\r\\\\nto June 1992, an additional 150 conferences in the social sciences and\\\\r\\\\nhumanities were added to this directory of listings.  Scholars have\\\\r\\\\nestablished conferences in virtually every field, within every different\\\\r\\\\ndiscipline.  For example, there are currently close to 600 active social\\\\r\\\\nscience and humanities  conferences on topics such as art and\\\\r\\\\narchitecture, ethnomusicology, folklore, Japanese culture, medical\\\\r\\\\neducation, and gifted and talented education.  The appeal to scholars of\\\\r\\\\ncommunicating through these conferences is that, unlike any other medium,\\\\r\\\\nelectronic conferences today provide a forum for global communication\\\\r\\\\nwith peers at the front end of the research process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInterpretation and analysis of sources constitutes the third process of\\\\r\\\\nscholarly communication that MICHELSON discussed in terms of texts and\\\\r\\\\ntextual resources.  The methods used to analyze sources fall somewhere on\\\\r\\\\na continuum from quantitative analysis to qualitative analysis.\\\\r\\\\nTypically, evidence is culled and evaluated using methods drawn from both\\\\r\\\\nends of this continuum.  At one end, quantitative analysis involves the\\\\r\\\\nuse of mathematical processes such as a count of frequencies and\\\\r\\\\ndistributions of occurrences or, on a higher level, regression analysis.\\\\r\\\\nAt the other end of the continuum, qualitative analysis typically\\\\r\\\\ninvolves nonmathematical processes oriented toward language\\\\r\\\\ninterpretation or the building of theory.  Aspects of this work involve\\\\r\\\\nthe processing--either manual or computational--of large and sometimes\\\\r\\\\nmassive amounts of textual sources, although the use of nontextual\\\\r\\\\nsources as evidence, such as photographs, sound recordings, film footage,\\\\r\\\\nand artifacts, is significant as well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScholars have discovered that many of the methods of interpretation and\\\\r\\\\nanalysis that are related to both quantitative and qualitative methods\\\\r\\\\nare processes that can be performed by computers.  For example, computers\\\\r\\\\ncan count.  They can count brush strokes used in a Rembrandt painting or\\\\r\\\\nperform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect.  By means\\\\r\\\\nof advanced technologies, computers can recognize patterns, analyze text,\\\\r\\\\nand model concepts.  Furthermore, computers can complete these processes\\\\r\\\\nfaster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who\\\\r\\\\nmust rely on manual interpretation of data.  But if scholars are to use\\\\r\\\\ncomputers for these processes, source materials must be in a form\\\\r\\\\namenable to computer-assisted analysis.  For this reason many scholars,\\\\r\\\\nonce they have identified the sources that are key to their research, are\\\\r\\\\nconverting them to machine-readable form.  Thus, a representative example\\\\r\\\\nof the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around\\\\r\\\\nthe world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the\\\\r\\\\nTLG, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae.  This project is devoted to\\\\r\\\\nconverting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece.  (Editor\\\\\\'s note:\\\\r\\\\naccording to the TLG Newsletter of May l992, TLG was in use in thirty-two\\\\r\\\\ndifferent countries.  This figure updates MICHELSON\\\\\\'s previous count by one.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize\\\\r\\\\nthat the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value\\\\r\\\\nfor other research purposes as well.  As a result, during the past few\\\\r\\\\nyears, humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to\\\\r\\\\nincrease scholarly access to converted text.  So, for example, the Text\\\\r\\\\nEncoding Initiative (TEI), about which more is said later in the program,\\\\r\\\\nwas established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements\\\\r\\\\nand methods for encoding machine-readable text for electronic exchange.\\\\r\\\\nIn a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text, scholars\\\\r\\\\nhave created a new institution, the Center for Electronic Texts in the\\\\r\\\\nHumanities (CETH).  The center estimates that there are 8,000 series of\\\\r\\\\nsource texts in the humanities that have been converted to\\\\r\\\\nmachine-readable form worldwide.  CETH is undertaking an international\\\\r\\\\nsearch for converted text in the humanities, compiling it into an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic library, and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the\\\\r\\\\nsources for the Research Libraries Information Network\\\\\\'s (RLIN)\\\\r\\\\nmachine-readable data file.  The library profession has begun to initiate\\\\r\\\\nlarge conversion projects as well, such as American Memory.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile scholars have been making converted text available to one another,\\\\r\\\\ntypically on disk or on CD-ROM, the clear trend is toward making these\\\\r\\\\nresources available through research and education networks.  Thus, the\\\\r\\\\nAmerican and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language\\\\r\\\\n(ARTFL) and the Dante Project are already available on Internet.\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON summarized this section on interpretation and analysis by\\\\r\\\\nnoting that:  1) increasing numbers of humanities scholars in the library\\\\r\\\\ncommunity are recognizing the importance to the advancement of\\\\r\\\\nscholarship of retrospective conversion of source materials in the arts\\\\r\\\\nand humanities; and 2) there is a growing realization that making the\\\\r\\\\nsources available on research and education networks maximizes their\\\\r\\\\nusefulness for the analysis performed by humanities scholars.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe fourth process of scholarly communication is dissemination of\\\\r\\\\nresearch findings, that is, publication.  Scholars are using existing\\\\r\\\\nresearch and education networks to engineer a new type of publication:\\\\r\\\\nscholarly-controlled journals that are electronically produced and\\\\r\\\\ndisseminated.  Although such journals are still emerging as a\\\\r\\\\ncommunication format, their number has grown, from approximately twelve\\\\r\\\\nto thirty-six during the past year (July 1991 to June 1992).  Most of\\\\r\\\\nthese electronic scholarly journals are devoted to topics in the\\\\r\\\\nhumanities.  As with network conferences, scholarly enthusiasm for these\\\\r\\\\nelectronic journals stems from the medium\\\\\\'s unique ability to advance\\\\r\\\\nscholarship in a way that no other medium can do by supporting global\\\\r\\\\nfeedback and interchange, practically in real time, early in the research\\\\r\\\\nprocess.  Beyond scholarly journals, MICHELSON remarked the delivery of\\\\r\\\\ncommercial full-text products, such as articles in professional journals,\\\\r\\\\nnewsletters, magazines, wire services, and reference sources.  These are\\\\r\\\\nbeing delivered via on-line local library catalogues, especially through\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROMs.  Furthermore, according to MICHELSON, there is general optimism\\\\r\\\\nthat the copyright and fees issues impeding the delivery of full text on\\\\r\\\\nexisting research and education networks soon will be resolved.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe final process of scholarly communication is curriculum development\\\\r\\\\nand instruction, and this involves the use of computer information\\\\r\\\\ntechnologies in two areas.  The first is the development of\\\\r\\\\ncomputer-oriented instructional tools, which includes simulations,\\\\r\\\\nmultimedia applications, and computer tools that are used to assist in\\\\r\\\\nthe analysis of sources in the classroom, etc.  The Perseus Project, a\\\\r\\\\ndatabase that provides a multimedia curriculum on classical Greek\\\\r\\\\ncivilization, is a good example of the way in which entire curricula are\\\\r\\\\nbeing recast using information technologies.  It is anticipated that the\\\\r\\\\ncurrent difficulty in exchanging electronically computer-based\\\\r\\\\ninstructional software, which in turn makes it difficult for one scholar\\\\r\\\\nto build upon the work of others, will be resolved before too long.\\\\r\\\\nStand-alone curricular applications that involve electronic text will be\\\\r\\\\nsharable through networks, reinforcing their significance as intellectual\\\\r\\\\nproducts as well as instructional tools.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe second aspect of electronic learning involves the use of research and\\\\r\\\\neducation networks for distance education programs.  Such programs\\\\r\\\\ninteractively link teachers with students in geographically scattered\\\\r\\\\nlocations and rely on the availability of electronic instructional\\\\r\\\\nresources.  Distance education programs are gaining wide appeal among\\\\r\\\\nstate departments of education because of their demonstrated capacity to\\\\r\\\\nbring advanced specialized course work and an array of experts to many\\\\r\\\\nclassrooms.  A recent report found that at least 32 states operated at\\\\r\\\\nleast one statewide network for education in 1991, with networks under\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment in many of the remaining states.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON summarized this section by noting two striking changes taking\\\\r\\\\nplace in scholarly communication among humanities scholars.  First is the\\\\r\\\\nextent to which electronic text in particular, and electronic resources\\\\r\\\\nin general, are being infused into each of the five processes described\\\\r\\\\nabove.  As mentioned earlier, there is a certain synergy at work here.\\\\r\\\\nThe use of electronic resources for one process tends to stimulate its\\\\r\\\\nuse for other processes, because the chief course of movement is toward a\\\\r\\\\ncomprehensive on-line working context for humanities scholars that\\\\r\\\\nincludes on-line availability of key bibliographies, scholarly feedback,\\\\r\\\\nsources, analytical tools, and publications.  MICHELSON noted further\\\\r\\\\nthat the movement toward a comprehensive on-line working context for\\\\r\\\\nhumanities scholars is not new.  In fact, it has been underway for more\\\\r\\\\nthan forty years in the humanities, since Father Roberto Busa began\\\\r\\\\ndeveloping an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas\\\\r\\\\nin 1949.  What we are witnessing today, MICHELSON contended, is not the\\\\r\\\\nbeginning of this on-line transition but, for at least some humanities\\\\r\\\\nscholars, the turning point in the transition from a print to an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic working context.  Coinciding with the on-line transition, the\\\\r\\\\nsecond striking change is the extent to which research and education\\\\r\\\\nnetworks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication.  The\\\\r\\\\nexisting Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network\\\\r\\\\n(NREN) represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for\\\\r\\\\nbibliographic information, scholarly dialogue and feedback, the most\\\\r\\\\ncurrent publications in their field, and high-level educational\\\\r\\\\nofferings.  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous\\\\r\\\\ntransformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of\\\\r\\\\nwhat is called network-mediated scholarship.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed\\\\r\\\\nat the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic\\\\r\\\\ntext, namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct\\\\r\\\\nof scholarly communication over the next decade:  1) end-user computing\\\\r\\\\nand 2) connectivity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEnd-user computing means that the person touching the keyboard, or\\\\r\\\\nperforming computations, is the same as the person who initiates or\\\\r\\\\nconsumes the computation.  The emergence of personal computers, along\\\\r\\\\nwith a host of other forces, such as ubiquitous computing, advances in\\\\r\\\\ninterface design, and the on-line transition, is prompting the consumers\\\\r\\\\nof computation to do their own computing, and is thus rendering obsolete\\\\r\\\\nthe traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe trend toward end-user computing is significant to consideration of\\\\r\\\\nthe prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are\\\\r\\\\nbecoming more adept at doing their own computations and, thus, more\\\\r\\\\ncompetent in the use of electronic media.  By avoiding programmer\\\\r\\\\nintermediaries, computation is becoming central to the researcher\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nthought process.  This direct involvement in computing is changing the\\\\r\\\\nresearcher\\\\\\'s perspective on the nature of research itself, that is, the\\\\r\\\\nkinds of questions that can be posed, the analytical methodologies that\\\\r\\\\ncan be used, the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for\\\\r\\\\nanalyses, and the form in which findings are presented.  The trend toward\\\\r\\\\nend-user computing means that, increasingly, electronic media and\\\\r\\\\ncomputation are being infused into all processes of humanities\\\\r\\\\nscholarship, inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly\\\\r\\\\ncommunication.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using\\\\r\\\\ncomputation increasingly in network environments.  Connectivity is\\\\r\\\\nimportant to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates\\\\r\\\\nstudents from teachers and scholars from their colleagues, while allowing\\\\r\\\\nusers to access remote databases, share information in many different\\\\r\\\\nmedia, connect to their working context wherever they are, and\\\\r\\\\ncollaborate in all phases of research.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe combination of the trend toward end-user computing and the trend\\\\r\\\\ntoward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic\\\\r\\\\nresources, already evident among some researchers, will soon become an\\\\r\\\\nestablished feature of scholarship.  The effects of these trends, along\\\\r\\\\nwith ongoing changes in scholarly practices, point to a future in which\\\\r\\\\nhumanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication\\\\r\\\\nto help them formulate ideas, access sources, perform research,\\\\r\\\\ncollaborate with colleagues, seek peer review, publish and disseminate\\\\r\\\\nresults, and engage in many other professional and educational activities.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn summary, MICHELSON emphasized four points:  1) A portion of humanities\\\\r\\\\nscholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for\\\\r\\\\nanalysis and dissemination.  2) Scholars are using these electronic\\\\r\\\\ntexts, in conjunction with other electronic resources, in all the\\\\r\\\\nprocesses of scholarly communication.  3) The humanities scholars\\\\\\'\\\\r\\\\nworking context is in the process of changing from print technology to\\\\r\\\\nelectronic technology, in many ways mirroring transformations that have\\\\r\\\\noccurred or are occurring within the scientific community.  4) These\\\\r\\\\nchanges are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new\\\\r\\\\ncommunication medium:  research and education networks that are\\\\r\\\\ncharacterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique\\\\r\\\\nway.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments:  l) Electronic\\\\r\\\\ntexts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other\\\\r\\\\nelectronic resources and the growing prominence of network-mediated\\\\r\\\\nscholarship.  2) The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity\\\\r\\\\nto be integrated into the on-line network of electronic resources that\\\\r\\\\ncomprise the new working context for scholars.  3) Retrospective conversion\\\\r\\\\nof portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information\\\\r\\\\nproviders respond to changes in scholarly communication practices.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA * AM\\\\\\'s evaluation project and public users of electronic resources\\\\r\\\\n* AM and its design * Site selection and evaluating the Macintosh\\\\r\\\\nimplementation of AM * Characteristics of the six public libraries\\\\r\\\\nselected * Characteristics of AM\\\\\\'s users in these libraries * Principal\\\\r\\\\nways AM is being used *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSusan VECCIA, team leader, and Joanne FREEMAN, associate coordinator,\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Memory, Library of Congress, gave a joint presentation.  First,\\\\r\\\\nby way of introduction, VECCIA explained her and FREEMAN\\\\\\'s roles in\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Memory (AM).  Serving principally as an observer, VECCIA has\\\\r\\\\nassisted with the evaluation project of AM, placing AM collections in a\\\\r\\\\nvariety of different sites around the country and helping to organize and\\\\r\\\\nimplement that project.  FREEMAN has been an associate coordinator of AM\\\\r\\\\nand has been involved principally with the interpretative materials,\\\\r\\\\npreparing some of the electronic exhibits and printed historical\\\\r\\\\ninformation that accompanies AM and that is requested by users.  VECCIA\\\\r\\\\nand FREEMAN shared anecdotal observations concerning AM with public users\\\\r\\\\nof electronic resources.  Notwithstanding a fairly structured evaluation\\\\r\\\\nin progress, both VECCIA and FREEMAN chose not to report on specifics in\\\\r\\\\nterms of numbers, etc., because they felt it was too early in the\\\\r\\\\nevaluation project to do so.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAM is an electronic archive of primary source materials from the Library\\\\r\\\\nof Congress, selected collections representing a variety of formats--\\\\r\\\\nphotographs, graphic arts, recorded sound, motion pictures, broadsides,\\\\r\\\\nand soon, pamphlets and books.  In terms of the design of this system,\\\\r\\\\nthe interpretative exhibits have been kept separate from the primary\\\\r\\\\nresources, with good reason.  Accompanying this collection are printed\\\\r\\\\ndocumentation and user guides, as well as guides that FREEMAN prepared for\\\\r\\\\nteachers so that they may begin using the content of the system at once.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA described the evaluation project before talking about the public\\\\r\\\\nusers of AM, limiting her remarks to public libraries, because FREEMAN\\\\r\\\\nwould talk more specifically about schools from kindergarten to twelfth\\\\r\\\\ngrade (K-12).   Having started in spring 1991, the evaluation currently\\\\r\\\\ninvolves testing of the Macintosh implementation of AM.  Since the\\\\r\\\\nprimary goal of this evaluation is to determine the most appropriate\\\\r\\\\naudience or audiences for AM, very different sites were selected.  This\\\\r\\\\nmakes evaluation difficult because of the varying degrees of technology\\\\r\\\\nliteracy among the sites.  AM is situated in forty-four locations, of\\\\r\\\\nwhich six are public libraries and sixteen are schools.  Represented\\\\r\\\\namong the schools are elementary, junior high, and high schools.\\\\r\\\\nDistrict offices also are involved in the evaluation, which will\\\\r\\\\nconclude in summer 1993.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA focused the remainder of her talk on the six public libraries, one\\\\r\\\\nof which doubles as a state library.  They represent a range of\\\\r\\\\ngeographic areas and a range of demographic characteristics.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample, three are located in urban settings, two in rural settings, and\\\\r\\\\none in a suburban setting.  A range of technical expertise is to be found\\\\r\\\\namong these facilities as well.  For example, one is an \"Apple library of\\\\r\\\\nthe future,\" while two others are rural one-room libraries--in one, AM\\\\r\\\\nsits at the front desk next to a tractor manual.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll public libraries have been extremely enthusiastic, supportive, and\\\\r\\\\nappreciative of the work that AM has been doing.  VECCIA characterized\\\\r\\\\nvarious users:  Most users in public libraries describe themselves as\\\\r\\\\ngeneral readers; of the students who use AM in the public libraries,\\\\r\\\\nthose in fourth grade and above seem most interested.  Public libraries\\\\r\\\\nin rural sites tend to attract retired people, who have been highly\\\\r\\\\nreceptive to AM.  Users tend to fall into two additional categories:\\\\r\\\\npeople interested in the content and historical connotations of these\\\\r\\\\nprimary resources, and those fascinated by the technology.  The format\\\\r\\\\nreceiving the most comments has been motion pictures.  The adult users in\\\\r\\\\npublic libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers, whereas young\\\\r\\\\npeople seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh, although most of\\\\r\\\\nthem seem to come from a Macintosh background.  This same tendency is\\\\r\\\\nfound in the schools.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat kinds of things do users do with AM?  In a public library there are\\\\r\\\\ntwo main goals or ways that AM is being used:  as an individual learning\\\\r\\\\ntool, and as a leisure activity.  Adult learning was one area that VECCIA\\\\r\\\\nwould highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM.  She\\\\r\\\\ndescribed a patron of a rural public library who comes in every day on\\\\r\\\\nhis lunch hour and literally reads AM, methodically going through the\\\\r\\\\ncollection image by image.  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic\\\\r\\\\nbookmark, puts it in his pocket, and returns to work.  The next day he\\\\r\\\\ncomes in and resumes where he left off.  Interestingly, this man had\\\\r\\\\nnever been in the library before he used AM.  In another small, rural\\\\r\\\\nlibrary, the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some\\\\r\\\\nof the older, retired people in the community, who ordinarily would not\\\\r\\\\nuse \"those things,\"--computers.  Another example of adult learning in\\\\r\\\\npublic libraries is book groups, one of which, in particular, is using AM\\\\r\\\\nas part of its reading on industrialization, integration, and urbanization\\\\r\\\\nin the early 1900s.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their\\\\r\\\\nchildren.  In another instance, individuals from a local museum came in\\\\r\\\\nto use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past.  These two examples\\\\r\\\\nemphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution,\\\\r\\\\nreaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to\\\\r\\\\nthose who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library.\\\\r\\\\nOne rural library reports that junior high school students in large\\\\r\\\\nnumbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment.  A number of\\\\r\\\\npublic libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the\\\\r\\\\nDetroit collection, which was essentially a collection of images used on\\\\r\\\\npostcards around the turn of the century.  Train buffs are similarly\\\\r\\\\ninterested because that was a time of great interest in railroading.\\\\r\\\\nPeople, it was found, relate to things that they know of firsthand.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample, in both rural public libraries where AM was made available,\\\\r\\\\nobservers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of\\\\r\\\\nthe turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection.\\\\r\\\\nThese examples served to underscore MICHELSON\\\\\\'s observation re the\\\\r\\\\nintegration of electronic tools and ideas--that people learn best when\\\\r\\\\nthe material relates to something they know.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a\\\\r\\\\npublic-relations tool for the public libraries that are testing it.  In\\\\r\\\\none case, AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for\\\\r\\\\nthe library.  In another case, AM has served as an inspiration to the\\\\r\\\\nstaff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to\\\\r\\\\nmake its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                  ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN * AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment *\\\\r\\\\nQuestions concerning context * Questions concerning the electronic format\\\\r\\\\nitself * Computer anxiety * Access and availability of the system *\\\\r\\\\nHardware * Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in\\\\r\\\\nschools *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReiterating an observation made by VECCIA, that AM is an archival\\\\r\\\\nresource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation,\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between\\\\r\\\\nthese bare primary materials and a school environment, and in that cause\\\\r\\\\nhas created guided introductions to AM collections.  Loud demand from the\\\\r\\\\neducational community,  chiefly from teachers working with the upper\\\\r\\\\ngrades of elementary school through high school, greeted the announcement\\\\r\\\\nthat AM would be tested around the country.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, but also on several universal questions that were raised\\\\r\\\\nconcerning archival electronic resources in schools.  She discussed\\\\r\\\\nseveral strengths of this type of material in a school environment as\\\\r\\\\nopposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of\\\\r\\\\npaths to follow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school\\\\r\\\\nenvironment.  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of\\\\r\\\\nwhat the system contains.  Many students sit down at a computer resource\\\\r\\\\nand assume that, because AM comes from the Library of Congress, all of\\\\r\\\\nAmerican history is now at their fingertips.  As a result of that sort of\\\\r\\\\nmistaken judgment, some students are known to conclude that AM contains\\\\r\\\\nnothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not\\\\r\\\\nfind them.  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has\\\\r\\\\na sense of what the system contains.  Some students grope toward the idea\\\\r\\\\nof an archive, a new idea to them, since they have not previously\\\\r\\\\nexperienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat\\\\r\\\\nrandom information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself.\\\\r\\\\nFor instance, in a school environment it is often difficult both for\\\\r\\\\nteachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing.\\\\r\\\\nThey understand that it is a visual image, but they do not necessarily\\\\r\\\\nknow that it is a postcard from the turn of the century, a panoramic\\\\r\\\\nphotograph, or even machine-readable text of an eighteenth-century\\\\r\\\\nbroadside, a twentieth-century printed book, or a nineteenth-century\\\\r\\\\ndiary.  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school\\\\r\\\\nenvironment to grasp.  Because of that, it occasionally becomes difficult\\\\r\\\\nto draw conclusions from what one is viewing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer, which constitutes a\\\\r\\\\ndifficulty in using an electronic resource.  Though students in general\\\\r\\\\ndid not suffer from this anxiety, several older students feared that they\\\\r\\\\nwere computer-illiterate, an assumption that became self-fulfilling when\\\\r\\\\nthey searched for something but failed to find it.  FREEMAN said she\\\\r\\\\nbelieved that some teachers also fear computer resources, because they\\\\r\\\\nbelieve they lack complete control.  FREEMAN related the example of\\\\r\\\\nteachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the\\\\r\\\\nsystem.  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely\\\\r\\\\nstructured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their\\\\r\\\\ngrasp on what the system contained.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of\\\\r\\\\nthe system.  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication\\\\r\\\\nbetween school librarians and teachers.  Often AM sits in a school\\\\r\\\\nlibrary and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the\\\\r\\\\nsystem.  Teachers do not always take into their world new library\\\\r\\\\nresources about which the librarian is excited.  Indeed, at the sites\\\\r\\\\nwhere AM had been used most effectively within a library, the librarian\\\\r\\\\nwas required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use.  As\\\\r\\\\na result, several AM sites will have in-service sessions over a summer,\\\\r\\\\nin the hope that perhaps, with a more individualized link, teachers will\\\\r\\\\nbe more likely to use the resource.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA related issue in the school context concerned the number of\\\\r\\\\nworkstations available at any one location.  Centralization of equipment\\\\r\\\\nat the district level, with teachers invited to download things and walk\\\\r\\\\naway with them, proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were\\\\r\\\\nopen were also school hours.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnother issue was hardware.  As VECCIA observed, a range of sites exists,\\\\r\\\\nsome technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their\\\\r\\\\nfirst computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with\\\\r\\\\nAM\\\\\\'s testing.  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even\\\\r\\\\nmore sophisticated hardware, so that they can perform even more\\\\r\\\\nsophisticated tasks with the materials in AM.  But once they acquire a\\\\r\\\\nnewer piece of hardware, they must learn how to use that also; at an\\\\r\\\\nunsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become\\\\r\\\\naccustomed to the computer, not to mention the program offered with the\\\\r\\\\ncomputer.  All of these small issues raise one large question, namely,\\\\r\\\\nare systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment, or do they\\\\r\\\\nsimply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths\\\\r\\\\nthat were gained through the use of archival resources in schools, including:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast, rich database, with\\\\r\\\\n     teachers assigning various projects to students--oral presentations,\\\\r\\\\n     written reports, a documentary, a turn-of-the-century newspaper--\\\\r\\\\n     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using\\\\r\\\\n     other resources; AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction\\\\r\\\\n     with other electronic resources, as well as with books and items in\\\\r\\\\n     the library where the system is set up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines\\\\r\\\\n     that often exists in schools.  For example, many English teachers are\\\\r\\\\n     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics\\\\r\\\\n     represented in AM.  Numerous teachers have reported that their\\\\r\\\\n     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * On a broader level, AM is introducing primary materials, not only\\\\r\\\\n     to students but also to teachers, in an environment where often\\\\r\\\\n     simply none exist--an exciting thing for the students because it\\\\r\\\\n     helps them learn to conduct research, to interpret, and to draw\\\\r\\\\n     their own conclusions.  In learning to conduct research and what it\\\\r\\\\n     means, students are motivated to seek knowledge.  That relates to\\\\r\\\\n     another positive outcome--a high level of personal involvement of\\\\r\\\\n     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to\\\\r\\\\n     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival\\\\r\\\\n     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed\\\\r\\\\n     were desperate, it is no exaggeration to say, not only for primary\\\\r\\\\n     materials but for unstructured primary materials.  These would, they\\\\r\\\\n     thought, foster personally motivated research, exploration, and\\\\r\\\\n     excitement in their students.  Indeed, these materials have done\\\\r\\\\n     just that.  Ironically, however, this lack of structure produces\\\\r\\\\n     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of\\\\r\\\\n     resources may also contribute.  The key to effective use of archival\\\\r\\\\n     products in a school environment is a clear, effective introduction\\\\r\\\\n     to the system and to what it contains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Nothing known, quantitatively, about the number of\\\\r\\\\nhumanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would\\\\r\\\\nsettle for an edited transcript, or about the ways in which humanities\\\\r\\\\nscholars are using information technology * Firm conclusions concerning\\\\r\\\\nthe manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print\\\\r\\\\nprovided by AM to await completion of evaluative study * A listener\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nreflections on additional applications of electronic texts * Role of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON,\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA, and FREEMAN, additional points emerged.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original,\\\\r\\\\nor the best possible version of the material, versus those who typically\\\\r\\\\nwould settle for an edited transcript.  While unable to provide a figure,\\\\r\\\\nshe offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference\\\\r\\\\nwork and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform\\\\r\\\\nreference, that those who use archives and those who use primary sources\\\\r\\\\nfor what would be considered very high-level scholarly research, as\\\\r\\\\nopposed to, say, undergraduate papers, were few in number, especially\\\\r\\\\ngiven the public interest in using primary sources to conduct\\\\r\\\\ngenealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional\\\\r\\\\nresearch done by people in private industry or the federal government.\\\\r\\\\nMore important in MICHELSON\\\\\\'s view was that, quantitatively, nothing is\\\\r\\\\nknown about the ways in which, for example, humanities scholars are using\\\\r\\\\ninformation technology.  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating\\\\r\\\\nstrategies.  The most recent study was conducted in 1985 by the American\\\\r\\\\nCouncil of Learned Societies (ACLS), and what it showed was that 50\\\\r\\\\npercent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers.  That\\\\r\\\\nconstitutes the extent of our knowledge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning AM\\\\\\'s strategy for orienting people toward the scope of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic resources, FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this\\\\r\\\\npoint, because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see,\\\\r\\\\nparticularly in the schools, what has been made of their efforts.  Within\\\\r\\\\nthe system, however, AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits-\\\\r\\\\n-such as introductions to time periods and materials--and these are\\\\r\\\\nintended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what\\\\r\\\\nit might tell her or him.  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff\\\\r\\\\nwould have to talk with students next year, after teachers have had a\\\\r\\\\nsummer to use the materials, and attempt to discover what the students\\\\r\\\\nwere learning from the materials.  In addition, FREEMAN described\\\\r\\\\nsupporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local\\\\r\\\\nteachers during a meeting held at LC.  These included time lines,\\\\r\\\\nbibliographies, and other materials that could be reproduced on a\\\\r\\\\nphotocopier in a classroom.  Teachers could walk away with and use these,\\\\r\\\\nand in this way gain a better understanding of the contents.  But again,\\\\r\\\\nreaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use\\\\r\\\\nwould have to wait until next year.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records\\\\r\\\\nAdministration (NARA) as a result of the increasing emphasis on\\\\r\\\\ntechnology in scholarly research, MICHELSON stated that NARA at this\\\\r\\\\npoint was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing\\\\r\\\\nstrategies for the archival profession in general, although not for the\\\\r\\\\nNational Archives specifically.  NARA is just beginning to establish its\\\\r\\\\nrole and what it can do.  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA\\\\r\\\\ncan take, no clear response could be given at this time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session.  Reflecting on\\\\r\\\\nDALY\\\\\\'s opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of\\\\r\\\\ntext in an electronic form, he said that at first he thought most scholars\\\\r\\\\nwould be unwilling to do that.  But as he thought of that in terms of the\\\\r\\\\noriginal meaning of research--that is, having already mastered these texts,\\\\r\\\\nresearching them for critical and comparative purposes--for the first time,\\\\r\\\\nthe electronic format made a lot of sense.  GREENFIELD could envision\\\\r\\\\ngrowing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very\\\\r\\\\naspect of their scholarship and for convenience\\\\\\'s sake.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nListening to VECCIA and FREEMAN, GREENFIELD thought of an additional\\\\r\\\\napplication of electronic texts.  He realized that AM could be used as a\\\\r\\\\nguide to lead someone to original sources.  Students cannot be expected\\\\r\\\\nto have mastered these sources, things they have never known about\\\\r\\\\nbefore.  Thus, AM is leading them, in theory, to a vast body of\\\\r\\\\ninformation and giving them a superficial overview of it, enabling them\\\\r\\\\nto select parts of it.  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this\\\\r\\\\nresource will indeed teach the new user, the K-12 students, how to do\\\\r\\\\nresearch.  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying\\\\r\\\\nthese new tools.  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking\\\\r\\\\nout things that were most exciting to them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELD\\\\\\'s observation as applied\\\\r\\\\nto a school environment.  The risk is that a student would sit down at a\\\\r\\\\nsystem, play with it, find some things of interest, and then walk away.\\\\r\\\\nBut in the relatively controlled situation of a school library, much will\\\\r\\\\ndepend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student.  She\\\\r\\\\nviewed the situation not as one of fine-tuning research skills but of\\\\r\\\\ninvolving students at a personal level in understanding and researching\\\\r\\\\nthings.  Given the guidance one can receive at school, it then becomes\\\\r\\\\npossible to teach elementary research skills to students, which in fact\\\\r\\\\none particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders.\\\\r\\\\nFREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following one\\\\\\'s own path\\\\r\\\\nof inquiry, which is essentially what research entails, involves more\\\\r\\\\nthan teaching specific skills.  To these comments VECCIA added the\\\\r\\\\nobservation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative\\\\r\\\\nresource, rather than AM itself, seemed to make the key difference.\\\\r\\\\nSome schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature\\\\r\\\\nof critical thinking and teaching skills, she said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcurring with these remarks, DALY closed the session with the thought that\\\\r\\\\nthe more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with\\\\r\\\\ntheir students, the more successful their electronic products would prove.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION II.

Funded primarily by the\\\\r\\\\nAnnenberg/CPB Project, with additional funding from Apple, Harvard, and\\\\r\\\\nthe Packard Humanities Institute, among others, Perseus is a multimedia,\\\\r\\\\nhypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek\\\\r\\\\ncivilization, which was released in February 1992 in version 1.0 and\\\\r\\\\ndistributed by Yale University Press.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConsisting entirely of primary materials, Perseus includes ancient Greek\\\\r\\\\ntexts and translations of those texts; catalog entries--that is, museum\\\\r\\\\ncatalog entries, not library catalog entries--on vases, sites, coins,\\\\r\\\\nsculpture, and archaeological objects; maps; and a dictionary, among\\\\r\\\\nother sources.  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog\\\\r\\\\nentries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images, which\\\\r\\\\nconstitute a major feature of the database.  Perseus contains\\\\r\\\\napproximately 30 megabytes of text, an amount that will double in\\\\r\\\\nsubsequent versions.  In addition to these primary materials, the Perseus\\\\r\\\\nProject has been building tools for using them, making access and\\\\r\\\\nnavigation easier, the goal being to build part of the electronic\\\\r\\\\nenvironment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or\\\\r\\\\nscholars can work with their sources.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work\\\\r\\\\nthat has gone into it, because the project had to face the dilemma of\\\\r\\\\nwhat to enter when putting something into machine-readable form:  should\\\\r\\\\none aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the\\\\r\\\\nmaterial in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality, all of\\\\r\\\\nits primary materials exist in a system-independent--insofar as it is\\\\r\\\\npossible to be system-independent--archival form.  Deciding what that\\\\r\\\\narchival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought.\\\\r\\\\nFor example, all the texts are marked up in SGML, which will be made\\\\r\\\\ncompatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) when\\\\r\\\\nthey are issued.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDrawings are postscript files, not meeting international standards, but\\\\r\\\\nat least designed to go across platforms.  Images, or rather the real\\\\r\\\\narchival forms, consist of the best available slides, which are being\\\\r\\\\ndigitized.  Much of the catalog material exists in database form--a form\\\\r\\\\nthat the average user could use, manipulate, and display on a personal\\\\r\\\\ncomputer, but only at great cost.  Thus, this is where the concession\\\\r\\\\ncomes in:  All of this rich, well-marked-up information is stripped of\\\\r\\\\nmuch of its content; the images are converted into bit-maps and the text\\\\r\\\\ninto small formatted chunks.  All this information can then be imported\\\\r\\\\ninto HyperCard and run on a mid-range Macintosh, which is what Perseus\\\\r\\\\nusers have.  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide\\\\r\\\\nuse fairly rapidly.  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version\\\\r\\\\nbeing demonstrated could not be made easily, and the project could not\\\\r\\\\nhave the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as\\\\r\\\\nthey appear, none of which information is in Perseus on the CD.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOf the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus, MYLONAS focused on the\\\\r\\\\ntextual.  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use, MYLONAS\\\\r\\\\nsaid, is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move\\\\r\\\\naround both visual and textual material.  Perseus also made the decision\\\\r\\\\nnot to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by\\\\r\\\\nselecting.  But, MYLONAS emphasized, Perseus is not courseware:  No\\\\r\\\\nsyllabus exists.  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic\\\\r\\\\nusing Perseus, although the project may eventually collect papers by\\\\r\\\\npeople who have used it to teach.  Rather, Perseus aims to provide\\\\r\\\\nprimary material in a kind of electronic library, an electronic sandbox,\\\\r\\\\nso to say, in which students and scholars who are working on this\\\\r\\\\nmaterial can explore by themselves.  With that, MYLONAS demonstrated\\\\r\\\\nPerseus, beginning with the Perseus gateway, the first thing one sees\\\\r\\\\nupon opening Perseus--an effort in part to solve the contextualizing\\\\r\\\\nproblem--which tells the user what the system contains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion, beginning with primary\\\\r\\\\ntexts and running off the CD-ROM.  Having selected Aeschylus\\\\\\' Prometheus\\\\r\\\\nBound, which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same\\\\r\\\\nsegments together, MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text,\\\\r\\\\nsomething not possible with a book:  looking up the dictionary entry form\\\\r\\\\nof an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus\\\\\\'\\\\r\\\\nmorphological analysis for all the texts.  After finding out about a\\\\r\\\\nword, a user may then decide to see if it is used anywhere else in Greek.\\\\r\\\\nBecause vast amounts of indexing support all of the primary material, one\\\\r\\\\ncan find out where else all forms of a particular Greek word appear--\\\\r\\\\noften not a trivial matter because Greek is highly inflected.  Further,\\\\r\\\\nsince the story of Prometheus has to do with the origins of sacrifice, a\\\\r\\\\nuser may wish to study and explore sacrifice in Greek literature; by\\\\r\\\\ntyping sacrifice into a small window, a user goes to the English-Greek\\\\r\\\\nword list--something one cannot do without the computer (Perseus has\\\\r\\\\nindexed the definitions of its dictionary)--the string sacrifice appears\\\\r\\\\nin the definitions of these sixty-five words.  One may then find out\\\\r\\\\nwhere any of those words is used in the work(s) of a particular author.\\\\r\\\\nThe English definitions are not lemmatized.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for\\\\r\\\\nspeed, MYLONAS observed; in other words, all that kind of information--\\\\r\\\\nall forms of all words, where they exist, the dictionary form they belong\\\\r\\\\nto--were collected into databases, which will expedite searching.  Then\\\\r\\\\nit was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases\\\\r\\\\nthat could not be done searching in the full texts.  Thus, although there\\\\r\\\\nare full-text searches in Perseus, much of the work is done behind the\\\\r\\\\nscenes, using prepared indices.  Re the indexing that is done behind the\\\\r\\\\nscenes, MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text, it\\\\r\\\\ncould not be done effectively.  Much of this indexing is based on the\\\\r\\\\nstructures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was found that one of the things many of Perseus\\\\\\' non-Greek-reading\\\\r\\\\nusers do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study\\\\r\\\\nof words and concepts via this kind of English-Greek word search, by which\\\\r\\\\nmeans they might select a concept.  This exercise has been assigned to\\\\r\\\\nstudents in core courses at Harvard--to study a concept by looking for the\\\\r\\\\nEnglish word in the dictionary, finding the Greek words, and then finding\\\\r\\\\nthe words in the Greek but, of course, reading across in the English.\\\\r\\\\nThat tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShould one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice, that\\\\r\\\\nperson would go to the object key word search, which allows one to\\\\r\\\\nperform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of\\\\r\\\\narchaeological objects.  Without words, pictures are useless; Perseus has\\\\r\\\\nnot reached the point where it can do much with images that are not\\\\r\\\\ncataloged.  Thus, although it is possible in Perseus with text and images\\\\r\\\\nto navigate by knowing where one wants to end up--for example, a\\\\r\\\\nred-figure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts--one can perform this\\\\r\\\\nkind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices.  MYLONAS\\\\r\\\\nillustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases.  The features\\\\r\\\\ndemonstrated derived from Perseus 1.0; version 2.0 will implement even\\\\r\\\\nbetter means of retrieval.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMYLONAS closed by looking at one of the pictures and noting again that\\\\r\\\\none can do a great deal of research using the iconography as well as the\\\\r\\\\ntexts.  For instance, students in a core course at Harvard this year were\\\\r\\\\nhighly interested in Greek concepts of foreigners and representations of\\\\r\\\\nnon-Greeks.  So they performed a great deal of research, both with texts\\\\r\\\\n(e.g., Herodotus) and with iconography on vases and coins, on how the\\\\r\\\\nGreeks portrayed non-Greeks.  At the same time, art historians who study\\\\r\\\\niconography were also interested, and were able to use this material.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus *\\\\r\\\\nSeveral features of Perseus 1.0 * Several levels of customization\\\\r\\\\npossible * Perseus used for general education * Perseus\\\\\\' effects on\\\\r\\\\neducation * Contextual information in Perseus * Main challenge and\\\\r\\\\nemphasis of Perseus *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeveral points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONAS\\\\\\'s presentation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlthough MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus\\\\\\' ability to cross-search\\\\r\\\\ndocuments, she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed\\\\r\\\\nand can be searched.  So, for example, sacrifice could have been searched\\\\r\\\\nin all texts, the historical essay, and all the catalogue entries with\\\\r\\\\ntheir descriptions--in short, in all of Perseus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBoolean logic is not in Perseus 1.0 but will be added to the next\\\\r\\\\nversion, although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a\\\\r\\\\ndatabase in which one just performs searching, Boolean or otherwise.  It\\\\r\\\\nis possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word\\\\r\\\\none is interested in and selecting an area of information one is\\\\r\\\\ninterested in and trying to look that word up in that area.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSince Perseus was developed in HyperCard, several levels of customization\\\\r\\\\nare possible.  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create\\\\r\\\\nannotated paths through the information, which are useful for note-taking\\\\r\\\\nand for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing.\\\\r\\\\nWith a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute\\\\r\\\\nmaterial in Perseus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general\\\\r\\\\neducation, where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core\\\\r\\\\ncourse at Harvard (a general required course that students must take in\\\\r\\\\ncertain areas).  Students were able to use primary material much more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland\\\\r\\\\nthat has been documenting Perseus\\\\\\' effects on education.  Perseus is very\\\\r\\\\npopular, and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at\\\\r\\\\nplaces other than Harvard, for example, test sites at Ball State\\\\r\\\\nUniversity, Drury College, and numerous small places where opportunities\\\\r\\\\nto use vast amounts of primary data may not exist.  One documented effect\\\\r\\\\nis that archaeological, anthropological, and philological research is\\\\r\\\\nbeing done by the same person instead of by three different people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay, a\\\\r\\\\nfairly linear historical essay on the fifth century B.C. that provides\\\\r\\\\nlinks into the primary material (e.g., Herodotus, Thucydides, and\\\\r\\\\nPlutarch), via small gray underscoring (on the screen) of linked\\\\r\\\\npassages.  These are handmade links into other material.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo different extents, most of the production work was done at Harvard,\\\\r\\\\nwhere the people and the equipment are located.  Much of the\\\\r\\\\ncollaborative activity involved data collection and structuring, because\\\\r\\\\nthe main challenge and the emphasis of Perseus is the gathering of\\\\r\\\\nprimary material, that is, building a useful environment for studying\\\\r\\\\nclassical Greece, collecting data, and making it useful.\\\\r\\\\nSystems-building is definitely not the main concern.  Thus, much of the\\\\r\\\\nwork has involved writing essays, collecting information, rewriting it,\\\\r\\\\nand tagging it.  That can be done off site.  The creative link for the\\\\r\\\\noverview essay as well as for both systems and data was collaborative,\\\\r\\\\nand was forged via E-mail and paper mail with professors at Pomona and\\\\r\\\\nBowdoin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA * PLD\\\\\\'s principal focus and contribution to scholarship *\\\\r\\\\nVarious questions preparatory to beginning the project * Basis for\\\\r\\\\nproject * Basic rule in converting PLD * Concerning the images in PLD *\\\\r\\\\nRunning PLD under a variety of retrieval softwares * Encoding the\\\\r\\\\ndatabase a hard-fought issue * Various features demonstrated * Importance\\\\r\\\\nof user documentation * Limitations of the CD-ROM version *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEric CALALUCA, vice president, Chadwyck-Healey, Inc., demonstrated a\\\\r\\\\nsoftware interpretation of the Patrologia Latina Database (PLD).  PLD\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nprincipal focus from the beginning of the project about three-and-a-half\\\\r\\\\nyears ago was on converting Migne\\\\\\'s Latin series, and in the end,\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA suggested, conversion of the text will be the major contribution\\\\r\\\\nto scholarship.  CALALUCA stressed that, as possibly the only private\\\\r\\\\npublishing organization at the Workshop, Chadwyck-Healey had sought no\\\\r\\\\nfederal funds or national foundation support before embarking upon the\\\\r\\\\nproject, but instead had relied upon a great deal of homework and\\\\r\\\\nmarketing to accomplish the task of conversion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEver since the possibilities of computer-searching have emerged, scholars\\\\r\\\\nin the field of late ancient and early medieval studies (philosophers,\\\\r\\\\ntheologians, classicists, and those studying the history of natural law\\\\r\\\\nand the history of the legal development of Western civilization) have\\\\r\\\\nbeen longing for a fully searchable version of Western literature, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, all the texts of Augustine and Bernard of Clairvaux and\\\\r\\\\nBoethius, not to mention all the secondary and tertiary authors.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVarious questions arose, CALALUCA said.  Should one convert Migne?\\\\r\\\\nShould the database be encoded?  Is it necessary to do that?  How should\\\\r\\\\nit be delivered?  What about CD-ROM?  Since this is a transitional\\\\r\\\\nmedium, why even bother to create software to run on a CD-ROM?  Since\\\\r\\\\neverybody knows people will be networking information, why go to the\\\\r\\\\ntrouble--which is far greater with CD-ROM than with the production of\\\\r\\\\nmagnetic data?  Finally, how does one make the data available?  Can many\\\\r\\\\nof the hurdles to using electronic information that some publishers have\\\\r\\\\nimposed upon databases be eliminated?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe PLD project was based on the principle that computer-searching of\\\\r\\\\ntexts is most effective when it is done with a large database.  Because\\\\r\\\\nPLD represented a collection that serves so many disciplines across so\\\\r\\\\nmany periods, it was irresistible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe basic rule in converting PLD was to do no harm, to avoid the sins of\\\\r\\\\nintrusion in such a database:  no introduction of newer editions, no\\\\r\\\\non-the-spot changes, no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an\\\\r\\\\nedition.  Thus, PLD is not the final act in electronic publishing for\\\\r\\\\nthis discipline, but simply the beginning.  The conversion of PLD has\\\\r\\\\nevoked numerous unanticipated questions:  How will information be used?\\\\r\\\\nWhat about networking?  Can the rights of a database be protected?\\\\r\\\\nShould one protect the rights of a database?  How can it be made\\\\r\\\\navailable?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThose converting PLD also tried to avoid the sins of omission, that is,\\\\r\\\\nexcluding portions of the collections or whole sections.  What about the\\\\r\\\\nimages?  PLD is full of images, some are extremely pious\\\\r\\\\nnineteenth-century representations of the Fathers, while others contain\\\\r\\\\nhighly interesting elements.  The goal was to cover all the text of Migne\\\\r\\\\n(including notes, in Greek and in Hebrew, the latter of which, in\\\\r\\\\nparticular, causes problems in creating a search structure), all the\\\\r\\\\nindices, and even the images, which are being scanned in separately\\\\r\\\\nsearchable files.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeveral North American institutions that have placed acquisition requests\\\\r\\\\nfor the PLD database have requested it in magnetic form without software,\\\\r\\\\nwhich means they are already running it without software, without\\\\r\\\\nanything demonstrated at the Workshop.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat cannot practically be done is go back and reconvert and re-encode\\\\r\\\\ndata, a time-consuming and extremely costly enterprise.  CALALUCA sees\\\\r\\\\nPLD as a database that can, and should, be run under a variety of\\\\r\\\\nretrieval softwares.  This will permit the widest possible searches.\\\\r\\\\nConsequently, the need to produce a CD-ROM of PLD, as well as to develop\\\\r\\\\nsoftware that could handle some 1.3 gigabyte of heavily encoded text,\\\\r\\\\ndeveloped out of conversations with collection development and reference\\\\r\\\\nlibrarians who wanted software both compassionate enough for the\\\\r\\\\npedestrian but also capable of incorporating the most detailed\\\\r\\\\nlexicographical studies that a user desires to conduct.  In the end, the\\\\r\\\\nencoding and conversion of the data will prove the most enduring\\\\r\\\\ntestament to the value of the project.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe encoding of the database was also a hard-fought issue:  Did the\\\\r\\\\ndatabase need to be encoded? Were there normative structures for encoding\\\\r\\\\nhumanist texts?  Should it be SGML?  What about the TEI--will it last,\\\\r\\\\nwill it prove useful?  CALALUCA expressed some minor doubts as to whether\\\\r\\\\na data bank can be fully TEI-conformant.  Every effort can be made, but\\\\r\\\\nin the end to be TEI-conformant means to accept the need to make some\\\\r\\\\nfirm encoding decisions that can, indeed, be disputed.  The TEI points\\\\r\\\\nthe publisher in a proper direction but does not presume to make all the\\\\r\\\\ndecisions for him or her.  Essentially, the goal of encoding was to\\\\r\\\\neliminate, as much as possible, the hindrances to information-networking,\\\\r\\\\nso that if an institution acquires a database, everybody associated with\\\\r\\\\nthe institution can have access to it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA demonstrated a portion of Volume 160, because it had the most\\\\r\\\\nanomalies in it.  The software was created by Electronic Book\\\\r\\\\nTechnologies of Providence, RI, and is called Dynatext.  The software\\\\r\\\\nworks only with SGML-coded data.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nViewing a table of contents on the screen, the audience saw how Dynatext\\\\r\\\\ntreats each element as a book and attempts to simplify movement through a\\\\r\\\\nvolume.  Familiarity with the Patrologia in print (i.e., the text, its\\\\r\\\\nsource, and the editions) will make the machine-readable versions highly\\\\r\\\\nuseful.  (Software with a Windows application was sought for PLD,\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA said, because this was the main trend for scholarly use.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA also demonstrated how a user can perform a variety of searches\\\\r\\\\nand quickly move to any part of a volume; the look-up screen provides\\\\r\\\\nsome basic, simple word-searching.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA argued that one of the major difficulties is not the software.\\\\r\\\\nRather, in creating a product that will be used by scholars representing\\\\r\\\\na broad spectrum of computer sophistication,  user documentation proves\\\\r\\\\nto be the most important service one can provide.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA next illustrated a truncated search under mysterium within ten\\\\r\\\\nwords of virtus and how one would be able to find its contents throughout\\\\r\\\\nthe entire database.  He said that the exciting thing about PLD is that\\\\r\\\\nmany of the applications in the retrieval software being written for it\\\\r\\\\nwill exceed the capabilities of the software employed now for the CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\nversion.  The CD-ROM faces genuine limitations, in terms of speed and\\\\r\\\\ncomprehensiveness, in the creation of a retrieval software to run it.\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA said he hoped that individual scholars will download the data,\\\\r\\\\nif they wish, to their personal computers, and have ready access to\\\\r\\\\nimportant texts on a constant basis, which they will be able to use in\\\\r\\\\ntheir research and from which they might even be able to publish.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(CALALUCA explained that the blue numbers represented Migne\\\\\\'s column numbers,\\\\r\\\\nwhich are the standard scholarly references.  Pulling up a note, he stated\\\\r\\\\nthat these texts were heavily edited and the image files would appear simply\\\\r\\\\nas a note as well, so that one could quickly access an image.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER/ERWAY * Several problems with which AM is still wrestling *\\\\r\\\\nVarious search and retrieval capabilities * Illustration of automatic\\\\r\\\\nstemming and a truncated search * AM\\\\\\'s attempt to find ways to connect\\\\r\\\\ncataloging to the texts * AM\\\\\\'s gravitation towards SGML * Striking a\\\\r\\\\nbalance between quantity and quality * How AM furnishes users recourse to\\\\r\\\\nimages * Conducting a search in a full-text environment * Macintosh and\\\\r\\\\nIBM prototypes of AM * Multimedia aspects of AM *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA demonstration of American Memory by its coordinator, Carl FLEISCHHAUER,\\\\r\\\\nand Ricky ERWAY, associate coordinator, Library of Congress, concluded\\\\r\\\\nthe morning session.  Beginning with a collection of broadsides from the\\\\r\\\\nContinental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, the only text\\\\r\\\\ncollection in a presentable form at the time of the Workshop, FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\nhighlighted several of the problems with which AM is still wrestling.\\\\r\\\\n(In its final form, the disk will contain two collections, not only the\\\\r\\\\nbroadsides but also the full text with illustrations of a set of\\\\r\\\\napproximately 300 African-American pamphlets from the period 1870 to 1910.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs FREEMAN had explained earlier, AM has attempted to use a small amount\\\\r\\\\nof interpretation to introduce collections.  In the present case, the\\\\r\\\\ncontractor, a company named Quick Source, in Silver Spring, MD., used\\\\r\\\\nsoftware called Toolbook and put together a modestly interactive\\\\r\\\\nintroduction to the collection.  Like the two preceding speakers,\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER argued that the real asset was the underlying collection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER proceeded to describe various search and retrieval\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities while ERWAY worked the computer.  In this particular package\\\\r\\\\nthe \"go to\" pull-down allowed the user in effect to jump out of Toolbook,\\\\r\\\\nwhere the interactive program was located, and enter the third-party\\\\r\\\\nsoftware used by AM for this text collection, which is called Personal\\\\r\\\\nLibrarian.  This was the Windows version of Personal Librarian, a\\\\r\\\\nsoftware application put together by a company in Rockville, Md.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSince the broadsides came from the Revolutionary War period, a search was\\\\r\\\\nconducted using the words British or war, with the default operator reset\\\\r\\\\nas or.  FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated both automatic stemming (which finds\\\\r\\\\nother forms of the same root) and a truncated search.  One of Personal\\\\r\\\\nLibrarian\\\\\\'s strongest features, the relevance ranking, was represented by\\\\r\\\\na chart that indicated how often words being sought appeared in\\\\r\\\\ndocuments, with the one receiving the most \"hits\" obtaining the highest\\\\r\\\\nscore.  The \"hit list\" that is supplied takes the relevance ranking into\\\\r\\\\naccount, making the first hit, in effect, the one the software has\\\\r\\\\nselected as the most relevant example.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile in the text of one of the broadside documents, FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\nremarked AM\\\\\\'s attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to the texts,\\\\r\\\\nwhich it does in different ways in different manifestations.  In the case\\\\r\\\\nshown, the cataloging was pasted on:  AM took MARC records that were\\\\r\\\\nwritten as on-line records right into one of the Library\\\\\\'s mainframe\\\\r\\\\nretrieval programs, pulled them out, and handed them off to the contractor,\\\\r\\\\nwho massaged them somewhat to display them in the manner shown.  One of\\\\r\\\\nAM\\\\\\'s questions is, Does the cataloguing normally performed in the mainframe\\\\r\\\\nwork in this context, or had AM ought to think through adjustments?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER made the additional point that, as far as the text goes, AM\\\\r\\\\nhas gravitated towards SGML (he pointed to the boldface in the upper part\\\\r\\\\nof the screen).  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate\\\\r\\\\nor interpret SGML, Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics\\\\r\\\\non screen; a fairly easy thing to do, but it is one of the ways in which\\\\r\\\\nSGML is useful.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStriking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern\\\\r\\\\nof AM, with accuracy being one of the places where project staff have\\\\r\\\\nfelt that less than 100-percent accuracy was not unacceptable.\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER cited the example of the standard of the rekeying industry,\\\\r\\\\nnamely 99.95 percent; as one service bureau informed him, to go from\\\\r\\\\n99.95 to 100 percent would double the cost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated how AM furnishes users recourse to images,\\\\r\\\\nand at the same time recalled LESK\\\\\\'s pointed question concerning the\\\\r\\\\nnumber of people who would look at those images and the number who would\\\\r\\\\nwork only with the text.  If the implication of LESK\\\\\\'s question was\\\\r\\\\nsound, FLEISCHHAUER said, it raised the stakes for text accuracy and\\\\r\\\\nreduced the value of the strategy for images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nContending that preservation is always a bugaboo, FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\ndemonstrated several images derived from a scan of a preservation\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm that AM had made.  He awarded a grade of C at best, perhaps a\\\\r\\\\nC minus or a C plus, for how well it worked out.  Indeed, the matter of\\\\r\\\\nlearning if other people had better ideas about scanning in general, and,\\\\r\\\\nin particular, scanning from microfilm, was one of the factors that drove\\\\r\\\\nAM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop.  Skew, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, was one of the issues that AM in its ignorance had not reckoned\\\\r\\\\nwould prove so difficult.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFurther, the handling of images of the sort shown, in a desktop computer\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling.\\\\r\\\\nUltimately, AM staff feel that perhaps the paper copy that is printed out\\\\r\\\\nmight be the most useful one, but they remain uncertain as to how much\\\\r\\\\non-screen reading users will do.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReturning to the text, FLEISCHHAUER asked viewers to imagine a person who\\\\r\\\\nmight be conducting a search in a full-text environment.  With this\\\\r\\\\nscenario, he proceeded to illustrate other features of Personal Librarian\\\\r\\\\nthat he considered helpful; for example, it provides the ability to\\\\r\\\\nnotice words as one reads.  Clicking the \"include\" button on the bottom\\\\r\\\\nof the search window pops the words that have been highlighted into the\\\\r\\\\nsearch.  Thus, a user can refine the search as he or she reads,\\\\r\\\\nre-executing the search and continuing to find things in the quest for\\\\r\\\\nmaterials.  This software not only contains relevance ranking, Boolean\\\\r\\\\noperators, and truncation, it also permits one to perform word algebra,\\\\r\\\\nso to say, where one puts two or three words in parentheses and links\\\\r\\\\nthem with one Boolean operator and then a couple of words in another set\\\\r\\\\nof parentheses and asks for things within so many words of others.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUntil they became acquainted recently with some of the work being done in\\\\r\\\\nclassics, the AM staff had not realized that a large number of the\\\\r\\\\nprojects that involve electronic texts were being done by people with a\\\\r\\\\nprofound interest in language and linguistics.  Their search strategies\\\\r\\\\nand thinking are oriented to those fields, as is shown in particular by\\\\r\\\\nthe Perseus example.  As amateur historians, the AM staff were thinking\\\\r\\\\nmore of searching for concepts and ideas than for particular words.\\\\r\\\\nObviously, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, searching for concepts and ideas and\\\\r\\\\nsearching for words may be two rather closely related things.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile displaying several images, FLEISCHHAUER observed that the Macintosh\\\\r\\\\nprototype built by AM contains a greater diversity of formats.  Echoing a\\\\r\\\\nprevious speaker, he said that it was easier to stitch things together in\\\\r\\\\nthe Macintosh, though it tended to be a little more anemic in search and\\\\r\\\\nretrieval.  AM, therefore, increasingly has been investigating\\\\r\\\\nsophisticated retrieval engines in the IBM format.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER demonstrated several additional examples of the prototype\\\\r\\\\ninterfaces:  One was AM\\\\\\'s metaphor for the network future, in which a\\\\r\\\\nkind of reading-room graphic suggests how one would be able to go around\\\\r\\\\nto different materials.  AM contains a large number of photographs in\\\\r\\\\nanalog video form worked up from a videodisc, which enable users to make\\\\r\\\\ncopies to print or incorporate in digital documents.  A frame-grabber is\\\\r\\\\nbuilt into the system, making it possible to bring an image into a window\\\\r\\\\nand digitize or print it out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated sound recording, which included texts.\\\\r\\\\nRecycled from a previous project, the collection included sixty 78-rpm\\\\r\\\\nphonograph records of political speeches that were made during and\\\\r\\\\nimmediately after World War I.  These constituted approximately three\\\\r\\\\nhours of audio, as AM has digitized it, which occupy 150 megabytes on a\\\\r\\\\nCD.  Thus, they are considerably compressed.  From the catalogue card,\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER proceeded to a transcript of a speech with the audio\\\\r\\\\navailable and with highlighted text following it as it played.\\\\r\\\\nA photograph has been added and a transcription made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConsiderable value has been added beyond what the Library of Congress\\\\r\\\\nnormally would do in cataloguing a sound recording, which raises several\\\\r\\\\nquestions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can\\\\r\\\\nafford to add and at what point, perhaps, this becomes more than AM could\\\\r\\\\nreasonably do or reasonably wish to do.  FLEISCHHAUER also demonstrated\\\\r\\\\na motion picture.  As FREEMAN had reported earlier, the motion picture\\\\r\\\\nmaterials have proved the most popular, not surprisingly.  This says more\\\\r\\\\nabout the medium, he thought, than about AM\\\\\\'s presentation of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBecause AM\\\\\\'s goal was to bring together things that could be used by\\\\r\\\\nhistorians or by people who were curious about history,\\\\r\\\\nturn-of-the-century footage seemed to represent the most appropriate\\\\r\\\\ncollections from the Library of Congress in motion pictures. These were\\\\r\\\\nthe very first films made by Thomas Edison\\\\\\'s company and some others at\\\\r\\\\nthat time.  The particular example illustrated was a Biograph film,\\\\r\\\\nbrought in with a frame-grabber into a window.  A single videodisc\\\\r\\\\ncontains about fifty titles and pieces of film from that period, all of\\\\r\\\\nNew York City.  Taken together, AM believes, they provide an interesting\\\\r\\\\ndocumentary resource.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Using the frame-grabber in AM * Volume of material processed\\\\r\\\\nand to be processed * Purpose of AM within LC * Cataloguing and the\\\\r\\\\nnature of AM\\\\\\'s material * SGML coding and the question of quality versus\\\\r\\\\nquantity *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the question-and-answer period that followed FLEISCHHAUER\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\npresentation, several clarifications were made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc.  The frame-grabber\\\\r\\\\ndevices create a window on a computer screen, which permits users to\\\\r\\\\ndigitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs.  It\\\\r\\\\nproduces a crude, rough-and-ready image that high school students can\\\\r\\\\nincorporate into papers, and that has worked very nicely in this way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCommenting on FLEISCHHAUER\\\\\\'s assertion that AM was looking more at\\\\r\\\\nsearching ideas than words, MYLONAS argued that without words an idea\\\\r\\\\ndoes not exist.  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated\\\\r\\\\nhis point more clearly.  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both\\\\r\\\\ntalking about the same thing.  By searching for words and by forcing\\\\r\\\\npeople to focus on the word, the Perseus Project felt that they would get\\\\r\\\\nthem to the idea.  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one\\\\r\\\\nkind of user than another.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this\\\\r\\\\nway, AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections,\\\\r\\\\nall of them photographic.  In the Macintosh environment, for example,\\\\r\\\\nthere probably are 35,000-40,000 photographs.  The sound recordings\\\\r\\\\nnumber sixty items.  The broadsides number about 300 items.  There are\\\\r\\\\n500 political cartoons in the form of drawings.  The motion pictures, as\\\\r\\\\nindividual items, number sixty to seventy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAM also has a manuscript collection, the life history portion of one of\\\\r\\\\nthe federal project series, which will contain 2,900 individual\\\\r\\\\ndocuments, all first-person narratives.  AM has in process about 350\\\\r\\\\nAfrican-American pamphlets, or about 12,000 printed pages for the period\\\\r\\\\n1870-1910.  Also in the works are some 4,000 panoramic photographs.  AM\\\\r\\\\nhas recycled a fair amount of the work done by LC\\\\\\'s Prints and\\\\r\\\\nPhotographs Division during the Library\\\\\\'s optical disk pilot project in\\\\r\\\\nthe 1980s.  For example, a special division of LC has tooled up and\\\\r\\\\nthought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of\\\\r\\\\nphotographs.  Indeed, they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads.\\\\r\\\\nThe purpose of AM within the Library, it is hoped, is to catalyze several\\\\r\\\\nof the other special collection divisions which have no particular\\\\r\\\\nexperience with, in some cases, mixed feelings about, an activity such as\\\\r\\\\nAM.  Moreover, in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not\\\\r\\\\nonly lacking experience in \"electronifying\" things but also in automated\\\\r\\\\ncataloguing.  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is\\\\r\\\\nheavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial\\\\r\\\\nmaterials, but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts\\\\r\\\\nand things that are held in the Library\\\\\\'s music collection and other\\\\r\\\\nunits.  In response to a comment by LESK, that AM\\\\\\'s material is very\\\\r\\\\nheavily photographic, and is so primarily because individual records have\\\\r\\\\nbeen made for each photograph, FLEISCHHAUER observed that an item-level\\\\r\\\\ncatalog record exists, for example, for each photograph in the Detroit\\\\r\\\\nPublishing collection of 25,000 pictures.  In the case of the Federal\\\\r\\\\nWriters Project, for which nearly 3,000 documents exist, representing\\\\r\\\\ninformation from twenty-six different states, AM with the assistance of\\\\r\\\\nKaren STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some way not\\\\r\\\\nonly to have a collection-level record but perhaps a MARC record for each\\\\r\\\\nstate, which will then serve as an umbrella for the 100-200 documents\\\\r\\\\nthat come under it.  But that drama remains to be enacted.  The AM staff\\\\r\\\\nis conservative and clings to cataloguing, though of course visitors tout\\\\r\\\\nartificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that\\\\r\\\\nperhaps one need not have cataloguing or that much of it could be put aside.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe matter of SGML coding, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, returned the discussion\\\\r\\\\nto the earlier treated question of quality versus quantity in the Library\\\\r\\\\nof Congress.  Of course, text conversion can be done with 100-percent\\\\r\\\\naccuracy, but it means that when one\\\\\\'s holdings are as vast as LC\\\\\\'s only\\\\r\\\\na tiny amount will be exposed, whereas permitting lower levels of\\\\r\\\\naccuracy can lead to exposing or sharing larger amounts, but with the\\\\r\\\\nquality correspondingly impaired.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nTWOHIG * A contrary experience concerning electronic options * Volume of\\\\r\\\\nmaterial in the Washington papers and a suggestion of David Packard *\\\\r\\\\nImplications of Packard\\\\\\'s suggestion * Transcribing the documents for the\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM * Accuracy of transcriptions * The CD-ROM edition of the Founding\\\\r\\\\nFathers documents *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSON\\\\\\'s from the morning\\\\r\\\\nsession--that numerous people in the humanities were choosing electronic\\\\r\\\\noptions to do their work--Dorothy TWOHIG, editor, The Papers of George\\\\r\\\\nWashington, opened her illustrated talk by noting that her experience\\\\r\\\\nwith literary scholars and numerous people in editing was contrary to\\\\r\\\\nMICHELSON\\\\\\'s.  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars\\\\\\' complete ignorance of\\\\r\\\\nthe technological options available to them or their reluctance or, in\\\\r\\\\nsome cases, their downright hostility toward these options.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects\\\\r\\\\n(Jefferson at Princeton, Franklin at Yale, John Adams at the\\\\r\\\\nMassachusetts Historical Society, and Madison down the hall from her at\\\\r\\\\nthe University of Virginia), TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers,\\\\r\\\\nlike all of the projects, include both sides of the Washington\\\\r\\\\ncorrespondence and deal with some 135,000 documents to be published with\\\\r\\\\nextensive annotation in eighty to eighty-five volumes, a project that\\\\r\\\\nwill not be completed until well into the next century.  Thus, it was\\\\r\\\\nwith considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers\\\\r\\\\nProject (WPP) greeted David Packard\\\\\\'s suggestion that the papers of the\\\\r\\\\nFounding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively, and to the\\\\r\\\\ngreat benefit of American scholarship, via CD-ROM.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn pragmatic terms, funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite\\\\r\\\\nthe transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in\\\\r\\\\nthe WPP offices.  Further, since the costs of collecting, editing, and\\\\r\\\\nconverting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were\\\\r\\\\nrunning into the millions of dollars, and the considerable staffs\\\\r\\\\ninvolved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to\\\\r\\\\nproducing the work, the Packard Foundation\\\\\\'s suggestion had a\\\\r\\\\nrevolutionary aspect:  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the\\\\r\\\\nFounding Fathers papers would be available on CD-ROM to public and\\\\r\\\\ncollege libraries, even high schools, at a fraction of the cost--\\\\r\\\\n$100-$150 for the annual license fee--to produce a limited university\\\\r\\\\npress run of 1,000 of each volume of the published papers at $45-$150 per\\\\r\\\\nprinted volume.  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems\\\\r\\\\nand the corresponding constraints on librarians in smaller institutions\\\\r\\\\nwho wish to add these volumes to their collections, producing the\\\\r\\\\ndocuments on CD-ROM would likely open a greatly expanded audience for the\\\\r\\\\npapers.  TWOHIG stressed, however, that development of the Founding\\\\r\\\\nFathers CD-ROM is still in its infancy.  Serious software problems remain\\\\r\\\\nto be resolved before the material can be put into readable form.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFunding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to\\\\r\\\\ntranscribe the 75,000 or so documents of the Washington papers remaining\\\\r\\\\nto be transcribed onto computer disks.  Slides illustrated several of the\\\\r\\\\nproblems encountered, for example, the present inability of CD-ROM to\\\\r\\\\nindicate the cross-outs (deleted material) in eighteenth century\\\\r\\\\ndocuments.  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the\\\\r\\\\neighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and\\\\r\\\\ndelivered to the Packard offices in California, where they are converted\\\\r\\\\nto the CD-ROM, a process that is expected to consume five years to\\\\r\\\\ncomplete (that is, reckoning from David Packard\\\\\\'s suggestion made several\\\\r\\\\nyears ago, until about July 1994).  TWOHIG found an encouraging\\\\r\\\\nindication of the project\\\\\\'s benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars\\\\r\\\\nof the search functions of the CD-ROM, particularly in reducing the time\\\\r\\\\nspent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions.\\\\r\\\\nFor instance, the insertion of thousands of documents on the CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\ncurrently does not permit each document to be verified against the\\\\r\\\\noriginal manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear\\\\r\\\\nin the published edition.  However, the transcriptions receive a cursory\\\\r\\\\ncheck for obvious typos, the misspellings of proper names, and other\\\\r\\\\nerrors from the WPP CD-ROM editor.  Eventually, all documents that appear\\\\r\\\\nin the electronic version will be checked by project editors.  Although\\\\r\\\\nthis process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the\\\\r\\\\ngrounds that imperfect work may leave their offices, the advantages in\\\\r\\\\nmaking this material available as a research tool outweigh  fears about the\\\\r\\\\nmisspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCompletion of all five Founding Fathers projects (i.e., retrievability\\\\r\\\\nand searchability of all of the documents by proper names, alternate\\\\r\\\\nspellings, or varieties of subjects) will provide one of the richest\\\\r\\\\nsources of this size for the history of the United States in the latter\\\\r\\\\npart of the eighteenth century.  Further, publication on CD-ROM will\\\\r\\\\nallow editors to include even minutiae, such as laundry lists, not\\\\r\\\\nincluded in the printed volumes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt seems possible that the extensive annotation provided in the printed\\\\r\\\\nvolumes eventually will be added to the CD-ROM edition, pending\\\\r\\\\nnegotiations with the publishers of the papers.  At the moment, the\\\\r\\\\nFounding Fathers CD-ROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS, a computer\\\\r\\\\ndeveloped out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for\\\\r\\\\nthe use of classical scholars.  There are perhaps 400 IBYCUS computers in\\\\r\\\\nthe country, most of which are in university classics departments.\\\\r\\\\nUltimately, it is anticipated that the CD-ROM edition of the Founding\\\\r\\\\nFathers documents will run on any IBM-compatible or Macintosh computer\\\\r\\\\nwith a CD-ROM drive.  Numerous changes in the software will also occur\\\\r\\\\nbefore the project is completed.  (Editor\\\\\\'s note: an IBYCUS was\\\\r\\\\nunavailable to demonstrate the CD-ROM.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Several additional features of WPP clarified *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiscussion following TWOHIG\\\\\\'s presentation served to clarify several\\\\r\\\\nadditional features, including (1) that the project\\\\\\'s primary\\\\r\\\\nintellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the\\\\r\\\\nmaterial; (2) that the text transmitted to the CD-ROM people is not\\\\r\\\\nmarked up; (3) that cataloging and subject-indexing of the material\\\\r\\\\nremain to be worked out (though at this point material can be retrieved\\\\r\\\\nby name); and (4) that because all the searching is done in the hardware,\\\\r\\\\nthe IBYCUS is designed to read a CD-ROM which contains only sequential\\\\r\\\\ntext files.  Technically, it then becomes very easy to read the material\\\\r\\\\noff and put it on another device.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nLEBRON * Overview of the history of the joint project between AAAS and\\\\r\\\\nOCLC * Several practices the on-line environment shares with traditional\\\\r\\\\npublishing on hard copy * Several technical and behavioral barriers to\\\\r\\\\nelectronic publishing * How AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of\\\\r\\\\nclinical trials * Advantages of the electronic format and other features\\\\r\\\\nof OJCCT * An illustrated tour of the journal *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaria LEBRON, managing editor, The Online Journal of Current Clinical\\\\r\\\\nTrials (OJCCT), presented an illustrated overview of the history of the\\\\r\\\\njoint project between the American Association for the Advancement of\\\\r\\\\nScience (AAAS) and the Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC).  The\\\\r\\\\njoint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a\\\\r\\\\nreorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about\\\\r\\\\nthree years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate\\\\r\\\\norganizations.  In short, OJCCT represents the process of scholarly\\\\r\\\\npublishing on line.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLEBRON next discussed several practices the on-line environment shares\\\\r\\\\nwith traditional publishing on hard copy--for example, peer review of\\\\r\\\\nmanuscripts--that are highly important in the academic world.  LEBRON\\\\r\\\\nnoted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure\\\\r\\\\ncommittees and grants committees.  In the traditional hard-copy\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, citation counts are readily demonstrable, whereas the\\\\r\\\\non-line environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic\\\\r\\\\npublishing, for instance, the problems in transmission created by special\\\\r\\\\ncharacters or by complex graphics and halftones.  In addition, she noted\\\\r\\\\neconomic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues\\\\r\\\\nand market or audience education.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nManuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT, LEBRON explained, because it is\\\\r\\\\nnot a bulletin board or E-mail, forms of electronic transmission of\\\\r\\\\ninformation that have created an ambience clouding people\\\\\\'s understanding\\\\r\\\\nof what the journal is attempting to do.  OJCCT, which publishes\\\\r\\\\npeer-reviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical\\\\r\\\\ntrials, includes text, tabular material, and graphics, although at this\\\\r\\\\ntime it can transmit only line illustrations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNext, LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of\\\\r\\\\nclinical trials:  It is 1) a highly statistical discipline that 2) does\\\\r\\\\nnot require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line\\\\r\\\\nillustrations and graphic material, and 3) there is a need for the speedy\\\\r\\\\ndissemination of high-quality research results.  Clinical trials are\\\\r\\\\nresearch activities that involve the administration of a test treatment\\\\r\\\\nto some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is\\\\r\\\\nmade available to the general population.  LEBRON proceeded to give\\\\r\\\\nadditional information on OJCCT concerning its editor-in-chief, editorial\\\\r\\\\nboard, editorial content, and the types of articles it publishes\\\\r\\\\n(including peer-reviewed research reports and reviews), as well as\\\\r\\\\nfeatures shared by other traditional hard-copy journals.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of\\\\r\\\\ninformation, including raw data, and the absence of space constraints\\\\r\\\\nbecause pages do not exist.  (This latter fact creates an interesting\\\\r\\\\nsituation when it comes to citations.)  Nor are there any issues.  AAAS\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\ncapacity to download materials directly from the journal to a\\\\r\\\\nsubscriber\\\\\\'s printer, hard drive, or floppy disk helps ensure highly\\\\r\\\\naccurate transcription.  Other features of OJCCT include on-screen alerts\\\\r\\\\nthat allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original\\\\r\\\\ndocuments; on-line searching by subject, author, title, etc.; indexing of\\\\r\\\\nevery single word that appears in an article; viewing access to an\\\\r\\\\narticle by component (abstract, full text, or graphs); numbered\\\\r\\\\nparagraphs to replace page counts; publication in Science every thirty\\\\r\\\\ndays of indexing of all articles published in the journal;\\\\r\\\\ntypeset-quality screens; and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to\\\\r\\\\nbring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal,\\\\r\\\\nthrough the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through\\\\r\\\\nthe Internet if just an ASCII file is desired, LEBRON illustrated the\\\\r\\\\nspeedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags\\\\r\\\\nafter it has been accepted for publication.  She also gave an illustrated\\\\r\\\\ntour of the journal, its search-and-retrieval capabilities in particular,\\\\r\\\\nbut also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations,\\\\r\\\\nand the importance of on-screen alerts to the medical profession re\\\\r\\\\nretractions or corrections, or more frequently, editorials, letters to\\\\r\\\\nthe editors, or follow-up reports.  She closed by inviting the audience\\\\r\\\\nto join AAAS on 1 July, when OJCCT was scheduled to go on-line.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Additional features of OJCCT *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRON\\\\\\'s presentation, these\\\\r\\\\npoints emerged:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The SGML text can be tailored as users wish.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * All these articles have a fairly simple document definition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Document-type definitions (DTDs) were developed and given to OJCCT\\\\r\\\\n     for coding.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * No articles will be removed from the journal.  (Because there are\\\\r\\\\n     no back issues, there are no lost issues either.  Once a subscriber\\\\r\\\\n     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently\\\\r\\\\n     published materials, but retrospectively to everything that has been\\\\r\\\\n     published in it.  Thus the table of contents grows bigger.  The date\\\\r\\\\n     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published\\\\r\\\\n     materials and older materials.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical\\\\r\\\\n     journals:  for 1992, $95 for a year, plus telecommunications charges\\\\r\\\\n     (there are no connect time charges);    for 1993, $110 for the\\\\r\\\\n     entire year for single users, though the journal can be put on a\\\\r\\\\n     local area network (LAN).  However, only one person can access the\\\\r\\\\n     journal at a time.  Site licenses may come in the future.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display\\\\r\\\\n     mathematical equations on screen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Without compromising any steps in the editorial process, the\\\\r\\\\n     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is\\\\r\\\\n     originally submitted and the time it is accepted; the review process\\\\r\\\\n     does not differ greatly from the standard six-to-eight weeks\\\\r\\\\n     employed by many of the hard-copy journals.  The process still\\\\r\\\\n     depends on people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * As far as a preservation copy is concerned, articles will be\\\\r\\\\n     maintained on the computer permanently and subscribers, as part of\\\\r\\\\n     their subscription, will receive a microfiche-quality archival copy\\\\r\\\\n     of everything published during that year; in addition, reprints can\\\\r\\\\n     be purchased in much the same way as in a hard-copy environment.\\\\r\\\\n     Hard copies are prepared but are not the primary medium for the\\\\r\\\\n     dissemination of the information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Because OJCCT is not yet on line, it is difficult to know how many\\\\r\\\\n     people would simply browse through the journal on the screen as\\\\r\\\\n     opposed to downloading the whole thing and printing it out; a mix of\\\\r\\\\n     both types of users likely will result.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nPERSONIUS * Developments in technology over the past decade * The CLASS\\\\r\\\\nProject * Advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project *\\\\r\\\\nDeveloping a network application an underlying assumption of the project\\\\r\\\\n* Details of the scanning process * Print-on-demand copies of books *\\\\r\\\\nFuture plans include development of a browsing tool *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLynne PERSONIUS, assistant director, Cornell Information Technologies for\\\\r\\\\nScholarly Information Services, Cornell University, first commented on\\\\r\\\\nthe tremendous impact that developments in technology over the past ten\\\\r\\\\nyears--networking, in particular--have had on the way information is\\\\r\\\\nhandled, and how, in her own case, these developments have counterbalanced\\\\r\\\\nCornell\\\\\\'s relative geographical isolation.  Other significant technologies\\\\r\\\\ninclude scanners, which are much more sophisticated than they were ten years\\\\r\\\\nago; mass storage and the dramatic savings that result from it in terms of\\\\r\\\\nboth space and money relative to twenty or thirty years ago; new and\\\\r\\\\nimproved printing technologies, which have greatly affected the distribution\\\\r\\\\nof information; and, of course, digital technologies, whose applicability to\\\\r\\\\nlibrary preservation remains at issue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiven that context, PERSONIUS described the College Library Access and\\\\r\\\\nStorage System (CLASS) Project, a library preservation project,\\\\r\\\\nprimarily, and what has been accomplished.  Directly funded by the\\\\r\\\\nCommission on Preservation and Access and by the Xerox Corporation, which\\\\r\\\\nhas provided a significant amount of hardware, the CLASS Project has been\\\\r\\\\nworking with a development team at Xerox to develop a software\\\\r\\\\napplication tailored to library preservation requirements.  Within\\\\r\\\\nCornell, participants in the project have been working jointly with both\\\\r\\\\nlibrary and information technologies.  The focus of the project has been\\\\r\\\\non reformatting and saving books that are in brittle condition.\\\\r\\\\nPERSONIUS showed Workshop participants a brittle book, and described how\\\\r\\\\nsuch books were the result of developments in papermaking around the\\\\r\\\\nbeginning of the Industrial Revolution.  The papermaking process was\\\\r\\\\nchanged so that a significant amount of acid was introduced into the\\\\r\\\\nactual paper itself, which deteriorates as it sits on library shelves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne of the advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project is that\\\\r\\\\nthe information in brittle books is mostly out of copyright and thus\\\\r\\\\noffers an opportunity to work with material that requires library\\\\r\\\\npreservation, and to create and work on an infrastructure to save the\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.  Acknowledging the familiarity of those working in preservation\\\\r\\\\nwith this information, PERSONIUS noted that several things are being\\\\r\\\\ndone:  the primary preservation technology used today is photocopying of\\\\r\\\\nbrittle material.  Saving the intellectual content of the material is the\\\\r\\\\nmain goal.  With microfilm copy, the intellectual content is preserved on\\\\r\\\\nthe assumption that in the future the image can be reformatted in any\\\\r\\\\nother way that then exists.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn underlying assumption of the CLASS Project from the beginning was\\\\r\\\\nthat it would develop a network application.  Project staff scan books\\\\r\\\\nat a workstation located in the library, near the brittle material.\\\\r\\\\nAn image-server filing system is located at a distance from that\\\\r\\\\nworkstation, and a printer is located in another building.  All of the\\\\r\\\\nmaterials digitized and stored on the image-filing system are cataloged\\\\r\\\\nin the on-line catalogue.  In fact, a record for each of these electronic\\\\r\\\\nbooks is stored in the RLIN database so that a record exists of what is\\\\r\\\\nin the digital library throughout standard catalogue procedures.  In the\\\\r\\\\nfuture, researchers working from their own workstations in their offices,\\\\r\\\\nor their networks, will have access--wherever they might be--through a\\\\r\\\\nrequest server being built into the new digital library.  A second\\\\r\\\\nassumption is that the preferred means of finding the material will be by\\\\r\\\\nlooking through a catalogue.  PERSONIUS described the scanning process,\\\\r\\\\nwhich uses a prototype scanner being developed by Xerox and which scans a\\\\r\\\\nvery high resolution image at great speed.  Another significant feature,\\\\r\\\\nbecause this is a preservation application, is the placing of the pages\\\\r\\\\nthat fall apart one for one on the platen.  Ordinarily, a scanner could\\\\r\\\\nbe used with some sort of a document feeder, but because of this\\\\r\\\\napplication that is not feasible.  Further, because CLASS is a\\\\r\\\\npreservation application, after the paper replacement is made there, a\\\\r\\\\nvery careful quality control check is performed.  An original book is\\\\r\\\\ncompared to the printed copy and verification is made, before proceeding,\\\\r\\\\nthat all of the image, all of the information, has been captured.  Then,\\\\r\\\\na new library book is produced:  The printed images are rebound by a\\\\r\\\\ncommercial binder and a new book is returned to the shelf.\\\\r\\\\nSignificantly, the books returned to the library shelves are beautiful\\\\r\\\\nand useful replacements on acid-free paper that should last a long time,\\\\r\\\\nin effect, the equivalent of preservation photocopies.  Thus, the project\\\\r\\\\nhas a library of digital books.  In essence, CLASS is scanning and\\\\r\\\\nstoring books as 600 dot-per-inch bit-mapped images, compressed using\\\\r\\\\nGroup 4 CCITT (i.e., the French acronym for International Consultative\\\\r\\\\nCommittee for Telegraph and Telephone) compression.  They are stored as\\\\r\\\\nTIFF files on an optical filing system that is composed of a database\\\\r\\\\nused for searching and locating the books and an optical jukebox that\\\\r\\\\nstores 64 twelve-inch platters.  A very-high-resolution printed copy of\\\\r\\\\nthese books at 600 dots per inch is created, using a Xerox DocuTech\\\\r\\\\nprinter to make the paper replacements on acid-free paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPERSONIUS maintained that the CLASS Project presents an opportunity to\\\\r\\\\nintroduce people to books as digital images by using a paper medium.\\\\r\\\\nBooks are returned to the shelves while people are also given the ability\\\\r\\\\nto print on demand--to make their own copies of books.  (PERSONIUS\\\\r\\\\ndistributed copies of an engineering journal published by engineering\\\\r\\\\nstudents at Cornell around 1900 as an example of what a print-on-demand\\\\r\\\\ncopy of material might be like.  This very cheap copy would be available\\\\r\\\\nto people to use for their own research purposes and would bridge the gap\\\\r\\\\nbetween an electronic work and the paper that readers like to have.)\\\\r\\\\nPERSONIUS then attempted to illustrate a very early prototype of\\\\r\\\\nnetworked access to this digital library.  Xerox Corporation has\\\\r\\\\ndeveloped a prototype of a view station that can send images across the\\\\r\\\\nnetwork to be viewed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe particular library brought down for demonstration contained two\\\\r\\\\nmathematics books.  CLASS is developing and will spend the next year\\\\r\\\\ndeveloping an application that allows people at workstations to browse\\\\r\\\\nthe books.  Thus, CLASS is developing a browsing tool, on the assumption\\\\r\\\\nthat users do not want to read an entire book from a workstation, but\\\\r\\\\nwould prefer to be able to look through and decide if they would like to\\\\r\\\\nhave a printed copy of it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Re retrieval software * \"Digital file copyright\" * Scanning\\\\r\\\\nrate during production * Autosegmentation * Criteria employed in\\\\r\\\\nselecting books for scanning * Compression and decompression of images *\\\\r\\\\nOCR not precluded *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the question-and-answer period that followed her presentation,\\\\r\\\\nPERSONIUS made these additional points:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Re retrieval software, Cornell is developing a Unix-based server\\\\r\\\\n     as well as clients for the server that support multiple platforms\\\\r\\\\n     (Macintosh, IBM and Sun workstations), in the hope that people from\\\\r\\\\n     any of those platforms will retrieve books; a further operating\\\\r\\\\n     assumption is that standard interfaces will be used as much as\\\\r\\\\n     possible, where standards can be put in place, because CLASS\\\\r\\\\n     considers this retrieval software a library application and would\\\\r\\\\n     like to be able to look at material not only at Cornell but at other\\\\r\\\\n     institutions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The phrase \"digital file copyright by Cornell University\" was\\\\r\\\\n     added at the advice of Cornell\\\\\\'s legal staff with the caveat that it\\\\r\\\\n     probably would not hold up in court.  Cornell does not want people\\\\r\\\\n     to copy its books and sell them but would like to keep them\\\\r\\\\n     available for use in a library environment for library purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * In production the scanner can scan about 300 pages per hour,\\\\r\\\\n     capturing 600 dots per inch.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The Xerox software has filters to scan halftone material and avoid\\\\r\\\\n     the moire patterns that occur when halftone material is scanned.\\\\r\\\\n     Xerox has been working on hardware and software that would enable\\\\r\\\\n     the scanner itself to recognize this situation and deal with it\\\\r\\\\n     appropriately--a kind of autosegmentation that would enable the\\\\r\\\\n     scanner to handle halftone material as well as text on a single page.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The books subjected to the elaborate process described above were\\\\r\\\\n     selected because CLASS is a preservation project, with the first 500\\\\r\\\\n     books selected coming from Cornell\\\\\\'s mathematics collection, because\\\\r\\\\n     they were still being heavily used and because, although they were\\\\r\\\\n     in need of preservation, the mathematics library and the mathematics\\\\r\\\\n     faculty were uncomfortable having them microfilmed.  (They wanted a\\\\r\\\\n     printed copy.)  Thus, these books became a logical choice for this\\\\r\\\\n     project.  Other books were chosen by the project\\\\\\'s selection committees\\\\r\\\\n     for experiments with the technology, as well as to meet a demand or need.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Images will be decompressed before they are sent over the line; at\\\\r\\\\n     this time they are compressed and sent to the image filing system\\\\r\\\\n     and then sent to the printer as compressed images; they are returned\\\\r\\\\n     to the workstation as compressed 600-dpi images and the workstation\\\\r\\\\n     decompresses and scales them for display--an inefficient way to\\\\r\\\\n     access the material though it works quite well for printing and\\\\r\\\\n     other purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * CLASS is also decompressing on Macintosh and IBM, a slow process\\\\r\\\\n     right now.  Eventually, compression and decompression will take\\\\r\\\\n     place on an image conversion server.  Trade-offs will be made, based\\\\r\\\\n     on future performance testing, concerning where the file is\\\\r\\\\n     compressed and what resolution image is sent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * OCR has not been precluded; images are being stored that have been\\\\r\\\\n     scanned at a high resolution, which presumably would suit them well\\\\r\\\\n     to an OCR process.  Because the material being scanned is about 100\\\\r\\\\n     years old and was printed with less-than-ideal technologies, very\\\\r\\\\n     early and preliminary tests have not produced good results.  But the\\\\r\\\\n     project is capturing an image that is of sufficient resolution to be\\\\r\\\\n     subjected to OCR in the future.  Moreover, the system architecture\\\\r\\\\n     and the system plan have a logical place to store an OCR image if it\\\\r\\\\n     has been captured.  But that is not being done now.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION III.  DISTRIBUTION, NETWORKS, AND NETWORKING:  OPTIONS FOR\\\\r\\\\nDISSEMINATION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nZICH * Issues pertaining to CD-ROMs * Options for publishing in CD-ROM *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRobert ZICH, special assistant to the associate librarian for special\\\\r\\\\nprojects, Library of Congress, and moderator of this session, first noted\\\\r\\\\nthe blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very\\\\r\\\\ndistinguished people representing networks and networking or at least\\\\r\\\\nleaning in that direction, while lacking anyone to speak from the\\\\r\\\\nstrongest possible background in CD-ROMs.  ZICH expressed the hope that\\\\r\\\\nmembers of the audience would join the discussion.  He stressed the\\\\r\\\\nsubtitle of this particular session, \"Options for Dissemination,\" and,\\\\r\\\\nconcerning CD-ROMs, the importance of determining when it would be wise\\\\r\\\\nto consider dissemination in CD-ROM versus networks.  A shopping list of\\\\r\\\\nissues pertaining to CD-ROMs included:  the grounds for selecting\\\\r\\\\ncommercial publishers, and in-house publication where possible versus\\\\r\\\\nnonprofit or government publication.  A similar list for networks\\\\r\\\\nincluded:  determining when one should consider dissemination through a\\\\r\\\\nnetwork, identifying the mechanisms or entities that exist to place items\\\\r\\\\non networks, identifying the pool of existing networks, determining how a\\\\r\\\\nproducer  would choose between networks, and identifying the elements of\\\\r\\\\na business arrangement in a network.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOptions for publishing in CD-ROM:  an outside publisher versus\\\\r\\\\nself-publication.  If an outside publisher is used, it can be nonprofit,\\\\r\\\\nsuch as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical\\\\r\\\\nInformation Service (NTIS), in the case of government.  The pros and cons\\\\r\\\\nassociated with employing an outside publisher are obvious.  Among the\\\\r\\\\npros, there is no trouble getting accepted.  One pays the bill and, in\\\\r\\\\neffect, goes one\\\\\\'s way.  Among the cons, when one pays an outside\\\\r\\\\npublisher to perform the work, that publisher will perform the work it is\\\\r\\\\nobliged to do, but perhaps without the production expertise and skill in\\\\r\\\\nmarketing and dissemination that some would seek.  There is the body of\\\\r\\\\ncommercial publishers that do possess that kind of expertise in\\\\r\\\\ndistribution and marketing but that obviously are selective.  In\\\\r\\\\nself-publication, one exercises full control, but then one must handle\\\\r\\\\nmatters such as distribution and marketing.  Such are some of the options\\\\r\\\\nfor publishing in the case of CD-ROM.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the case of technical and design issues, which are also important,\\\\r\\\\nthere are many matters which many at the Workshop already knew a good\\\\r\\\\ndeal about:  retrieval system requirements and costs, what to do about\\\\r\\\\nimages, the various capabilities and platforms, the trade-offs between\\\\r\\\\ncost and performance, concerns about local-area networkability,\\\\r\\\\ninteroperability, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH * Creating networked information is different from using networks\\\\r\\\\nas an access or dissemination vehicle * Networked multimedia on a large\\\\r\\\\nscale does not yet work * Typical CD-ROM publication model a two-edged\\\\r\\\\nsword * Publishing information on a CD-ROM in the present world of\\\\r\\\\nimmature standards * Contrast between CD-ROM and network pricing *\\\\r\\\\nExamples demonstrated earlier in the day as a set of insular information\\\\r\\\\ngems * Paramount need to link databases * Layering to become increasingly\\\\r\\\\nnecessary * Project NEEDS and the issues of information reuse and active\\\\r\\\\nversus passive use * X-Windows as a way of differentiating between\\\\r\\\\nnetwork access and networked information * Barriers to the distribution\\\\r\\\\nof networked multimedia information * Need for good, real-time delivery\\\\r\\\\nprotocols * The question of presentation integrity in client-server\\\\r\\\\ncomputing in the academic world * Recommendations for producing multimedia\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nClifford LYNCH, director, Library Automation, University of California,\\\\r\\\\nopened his talk with the general observation that networked information\\\\r\\\\nconstituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just\\\\r\\\\nstarting to develop and not yet fully understood.  LYNCH contended that\\\\r\\\\ncreating genuinely networked information was different from using\\\\r\\\\nnetworks as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated\\\\r\\\\nand more subtle.  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate,\\\\r\\\\nfrom what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects, to what\\\\r\\\\nsort of a world of electronics information--scholarly, archival,\\\\r\\\\ncultural, etc.--they wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now.\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH suggested that to extrapolate directly from these projects would\\\\r\\\\nproduce unpleasant results.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPutting the issue of CD-ROM in perspective before getting into\\\\r\\\\ngeneralities on networked information, LYNCH observed that those engaged\\\\r\\\\nin multimedia today who wish to ship a product, so to say, probably do\\\\r\\\\nnot have much choice except to use CD-ROM:  networked multimedia on a\\\\r\\\\nlarge scale basically does not yet work because the technology does not\\\\r\\\\nexist.  For example, anybody who has tried moving images around over the\\\\r\\\\nInternet knows that this is an exciting touch-and-go process, a\\\\r\\\\nfascinating and fertile area for experimentation, research, and\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment, but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic\\\\r\\\\nabout committing to production systems at this time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis situation will change, LYNCH said.  He differentiated CD-ROM from\\\\r\\\\nthe practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM.  For LYNCH the problem with CD-ROM is not its portability or its\\\\r\\\\nslowness but the two-edged sword of having the retrieval application and\\\\r\\\\nthe user interface inextricably bound up with the data, which is the\\\\r\\\\ntypical CD-ROM publication model.  It is not a case of publishing data\\\\r\\\\nbut of distributing a typically stand-alone, typically closed system,\\\\r\\\\nall--software, user interface, and data--on a little disk.  Hence, all\\\\r\\\\nthe between-disk navigational issues as well as the impossibility in most\\\\r\\\\ncases of integrating data on one disk with that on another.  Most CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\nretrieval software does not network very gracefully at present.  However,\\\\r\\\\nin the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of\\\\r\\\\nwhat network information is or what the ground rules are for creating or\\\\r\\\\nusing it, publishing information on a CD-ROM does add value in a very\\\\r\\\\nreal sense.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH drew a contrast between CD-ROM and network pricing and in doing so\\\\r\\\\nhighlighted something bizarre in information pricing.  A large\\\\r\\\\ninstitution such as the University of California has vendors who will\\\\r\\\\noffer to sell information on CD-ROM for a price per year in four digits,\\\\r\\\\nbut for the same data (e.g., an abstracting and indexing database) on\\\\r\\\\nmagnetic tape, regardless of how many people may use it concurrently,\\\\r\\\\nwill quote a price in six digits.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat is packaged with the CD-ROM in one sense adds value--a complete\\\\r\\\\naccess system, not just raw, unrefined information--although it is not\\\\r\\\\ngenerally perceived that way.  This is because the access software,\\\\r\\\\nalthough it adds value, is viewed by some people, particularly in the\\\\r\\\\nuniversity environment where there is a very heavy commitment to\\\\r\\\\nnetworking, as being developed in the wrong direction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiven that context, LYNCH described the examples demonstrated as a set of\\\\r\\\\ninsular information gems--Perseus, for example, offers nicely linked\\\\r\\\\ninformation, but would be very difficult to integrate with other\\\\r\\\\ndatabases, that is, to link together seamlessly with other source files\\\\r\\\\nfrom other sources.  It resembles an island, and in this respect is\\\\r\\\\nsimilar to numerous stand-alone projects that are based on videodiscs,\\\\r\\\\nthat is, on the single-workstation concept.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs scholarship evolves in a network environment, the paramount need will\\\\r\\\\nbe to link databases.  We must link personal databases to public\\\\r\\\\ndatabases, to group databases, in fairly seamless ways--which is\\\\r\\\\nextremely difficult in the environments under discussion with copies of\\\\r\\\\ndatabases proliferating all over the place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the\\\\r\\\\nprojects demonstrated.  Several databases in a sense constitute\\\\r\\\\ninformation archives without a significant amount of navigation built in.\\\\r\\\\nEducators, critics, and others will want a layered structure--one that\\\\r\\\\ndefines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach\\\\r\\\\nspecific points.  In LYNCH\\\\\\'s view, layering will become increasingly\\\\r\\\\nnecessary, and not just within a single resource but across resources\\\\r\\\\n(e.g., tracing mythology and cultural themes across several classics\\\\r\\\\ndatabases as well as a database of Renaissance culture).  This ability to\\\\r\\\\norganize resources, to build things out of multiple other things on the\\\\r\\\\nnetwork or select pieces of it, represented for LYNCH one of the key\\\\r\\\\naspects of network information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nContending that information reuse constituted another significant issue,\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH commended to the audience\\\\\\'s attention Project NEEDS (i.e., National\\\\r\\\\nEngineering Education Delivery System).  This project\\\\\\'s objective is to\\\\r\\\\nproduce a database of engineering courseware as well as the components\\\\r\\\\nthat can be used to develop new courseware.  In a number of the existing\\\\r\\\\napplications, LYNCH said, the issue of reuse (how much one can take apart\\\\r\\\\nand reuse in other applications) was not being well considered.  He also\\\\r\\\\nraised the issue of active versus passive use, one aspect of which  is\\\\r\\\\nhow much information will be manipulated locally by users.  Most people,\\\\r\\\\nhe argued, may do a little browsing and then will wish to print.  LYNCH\\\\r\\\\nwas uncertain how these resources would be used by the vast majority of\\\\r\\\\nusers in the network environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH next said a few words about X-Windows as a way of differentiating\\\\r\\\\nbetween network access and networked information.  A number of the\\\\r\\\\napplications demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X\\\\r\\\\nacross the network, so that one could run them from any X-capable device-\\\\r\\\\n-a workstation, an X terminal--and transact with a database across the\\\\r\\\\nnetwork.  Although this opens up access a little, assuming one has enough\\\\r\\\\nnetwork to handle it, it does not provide an interface to develop a\\\\r\\\\nprogram that conveniently integrates information from multiple databases.\\\\r\\\\nX is a viewing technology that has limits.  In a real sense, it is just a\\\\r\\\\ngraphical version of remote log-in across the network.  X-type applications\\\\r\\\\nrepresent only one step in the progression towards real access.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH next discussed barriers to the distribution of networked multimedia\\\\r\\\\ninformation.  The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide\\\\r\\\\nthe ability for computers to talk to each other, retrieve information,\\\\r\\\\nand shuffle it around fairly casually.  At the moment, little progress is\\\\r\\\\nbeing made on standards for networked information; for example, present\\\\r\\\\nstandards do not cover images, digital voice, and digital video.  A\\\\r\\\\nuseful tool kit of exchange formats for basic texts is only now being\\\\r\\\\nassembled.  The synchronization of content streams (i.e., synchronizing a\\\\r\\\\nvoice track to a video track, establishing temporal relations between\\\\r\\\\ndifferent components in a multimedia object) constitutes another issue\\\\r\\\\nfor networked multimedia that is just beginning to receive attention.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUnderlying network protocols also need some work; good, real-time\\\\r\\\\ndelivery protocols on the Internet do not yet exist.  In LYNCH\\\\\\'s view,\\\\r\\\\nhighly important in this context is the notion of networked digital\\\\r\\\\nobject IDs, the ability of one object on the network to point to another\\\\r\\\\nobject (or component thereof) on the network.  Serious bandwidth issues\\\\r\\\\nalso exist.  LYNCH was uncertain if billion-bit-per-second networks would\\\\r\\\\nprove sufficient if numerous people ran video in parallel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider,\\\\r\\\\nas well as several comments about what might constitute good trial\\\\r\\\\nmultimedia experiments.  In a networked information world the database\\\\r\\\\nbuilder or service builder (publisher) does not exercise the same\\\\r\\\\nextensive control over the integrity of the presentation; strange\\\\r\\\\nprograms \"munge\" with one\\\\\\'s data before the user sees it.  Serious\\\\r\\\\nthought must be given to what guarantees integrity of presentation.  Part\\\\r\\\\nof that is related to where one draws the boundaries around a networked\\\\r\\\\ninformation service.  This question of presentation integrity in\\\\r\\\\nclient-server computing has not been stressed enough in the academic\\\\r\\\\nworld, LYNCH argued, though commercial service providers deal with it\\\\r\\\\nregularly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning multimedia, LYNCH observed that good multimedia at the moment\\\\r\\\\nis hideously expensive to produce.  He recommended producing multimedia\\\\r\\\\nwith either very high sale value, or multimedia with a very long life\\\\r\\\\nspan, or multimedia that will have a very broad usage base and whose\\\\r\\\\ncosts therefore can be amortized among large numbers of users.  In this\\\\r\\\\nconnection, historical and humanistically oriented material may be a good\\\\r\\\\nplace to start, because it tends to have a longer life span than much of\\\\r\\\\nthe scientific material, as well as a wider user base.  LYNCH noted, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, that American Memory fits many of the criteria outlined.  He\\\\r\\\\nremarked the extensive discussion about bringing the Internet or the\\\\r\\\\nNational Research and Education Network (NREN) into the K-12 environment\\\\r\\\\nas a way of helping the American educational system.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH closed by noting that the kinds of applications demonstrated struck\\\\r\\\\nhim as excellent justifications of broad-scale networking for K-12, but\\\\r\\\\nthat at this time no \"killer\" application exists to mobilize the K-12\\\\r\\\\ncommunity to obtain connectivity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Dearth of genuinely interesting applications on the network\\\\r\\\\na slow-changing situation * The issue of the integrity of presentation in\\\\r\\\\na networked environment * Several reasons why CD-ROM software does not\\\\r\\\\nnetwork *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the discussion period that followed LYNCH\\\\\\'s presentation, several\\\\r\\\\nadditional points were made.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH reiterated even more strongly his contention that, historically,\\\\r\\\\nonce one goes outside high-end science and the group of those who need\\\\r\\\\naccess to supercomputers, there is a great dearth of genuinely\\\\r\\\\ninteresting applications on the network.  He saw this situation changing\\\\r\\\\nslowly, with some of the scientific databases and scholarly discussion\\\\r\\\\ngroups and electronic journals coming on as well as with the availability\\\\r\\\\nof Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) and some of the databases that\\\\r\\\\nare being mounted there.  However, many of those things do not seem to\\\\r\\\\nhave piqued great popular interest.  For instance, most high school\\\\r\\\\nstudents of LYNCH\\\\\\'s acquaintance would not qualify as devotees of serious\\\\r\\\\nmolecular biology.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning the issue of the integrity of presentation, LYNCH believed\\\\r\\\\nthat a couple of information providers have laid down the law at least on\\\\r\\\\ncertain things.  For example, his recollection was that the National\\\\r\\\\nLibrary of Medicine feels strongly that one needs to employ the\\\\r\\\\nidentifier field if he or she is to mount a database commercially.  The\\\\r\\\\nproblem with a real networked environment is that one does not know who\\\\r\\\\nis reformatting and reprocessing one\\\\\\'s data when one enters a client\\\\r\\\\nserver mode.  It becomes anybody\\\\\\'s guess, for example, if the network\\\\r\\\\nuses a Z39.50 server, or what clients are doing with one\\\\\\'s data.  A data\\\\r\\\\nprovider can say that his contract will only permit clients to have\\\\r\\\\naccess to his data after he vets them and their presentation and makes\\\\r\\\\ncertain it suits him.  But LYNCH held out little expectation that the\\\\r\\\\nnetwork marketplace would evolve in that way, because it required too\\\\r\\\\nmuch prior negotiation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM software does not network for a variety of reasons, LYNCH said.\\\\r\\\\nHe speculated that CD-ROM publishers are not eager to have their products\\\\r\\\\nreally hook into wide area networks, because they fear it will make their\\\\r\\\\ndata suppliers nervous.  Moreover, until relatively recently, one had to\\\\r\\\\nbe rather adroit to run a full TCP/IP stack plus applications on a\\\\r\\\\nPC-size machine, whereas nowadays it is becoming easier as PCs grow\\\\r\\\\nbigger and faster.  LYNCH also speculated that software providers had not\\\\r\\\\nheard from their customers until the last year or so, or had not heard\\\\r\\\\nfrom enough of their customers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nBESSER * Implications of disseminating images on the network; planning\\\\r\\\\nthe distribution of multimedia documents poses two critical\\\\r\\\\nimplementation problems * Layered approach represents the way to deal\\\\r\\\\nwith users\\\\\\' capabilities * Problems in platform design; file size and its\\\\r\\\\nimplications for networking * Transmission of megabyte size images\\\\r\\\\nimpractical * Compression and decompression at the user\\\\\\'s end * Promising\\\\r\\\\ntrends for compression * A disadvantage of using X-Windows * A project at\\\\r\\\\nthe Smithsonian that mounts images on several networks *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHoward BESSER, School of Library and Information Science, University of\\\\r\\\\nPittsburgh, spoke primarily about multimedia, focusing on images and the\\\\r\\\\nbroad implications of disseminating them on the network.  He argued that\\\\r\\\\nplanning the distribution of multimedia documents posed two critical\\\\r\\\\nimplementation problems, which he framed in the form of two questions:\\\\r\\\\n1) What platform will one use and what hardware and software will users\\\\r\\\\nhave for viewing of the material?  and 2) How can one deliver a\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently robust set of information in an accessible format in a\\\\r\\\\nreasonable amount of time?  Depending on whether network or CD-ROM is the\\\\r\\\\nmedium used, this question raises different issues of storage,\\\\r\\\\ncompression, and transmission.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning the design of platforms (e.g., sound, gray scale, simple\\\\r\\\\ncolor, etc.) and the various capabilities users may have, BESSER\\\\r\\\\nmaintained that a layered approach was the way to deal with users\\\\\\'\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities.  A result would be that users with less powerful\\\\r\\\\nworkstations would simply have less functionality.  He urged members of\\\\r\\\\nthe audience to advocate standards and accompanying software that handle\\\\r\\\\nlayered functionality across a wide variety of platforms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER also addressed problems in platform design, namely, deciding how\\\\r\\\\nlarge a machine to design for situations when the largest number of users\\\\r\\\\nhave the lowest level of the machine, and one desires higher\\\\r\\\\nfunctionality.  BESSER then proceeded to the question of file size and\\\\r\\\\nits implications for networking.  He discussed still images in the main.\\\\r\\\\nFor example, a digital color image that fills the screen of a standard\\\\r\\\\nmega-pel workstation (Sun or Next) will require one megabyte of storage\\\\r\\\\nfor an eight-bit image or three megabytes of storage for a true color or\\\\r\\\\ntwenty-four-bit image.  Lossless compression algorithms (that is,\\\\r\\\\ncomputational procedures in which no data is lost in the process of\\\\r\\\\ncompressing [and decompressing] an image--the exact bit-representation is\\\\r\\\\nmaintained) might bring storage down to a third of a megabyte per image,\\\\r\\\\nbut not much further than that.  The question of size makes it difficult\\\\r\\\\nto fit an appropriately sized set of these images on a single disk or to\\\\r\\\\ntransmit them quickly enough on a network.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith these full screen mega-pel images that constitute a third of a\\\\r\\\\nmegabyte, one gets 1,000-3,000 full-screen images on a one-gigabyte disk;\\\\r\\\\na standard CD-ROM represents approximately 60 percent of that.  Storing\\\\r\\\\nimages the size of a PC screen (just 8 bit color) increases storage\\\\r\\\\ncapacity to 4,000-12,000 images per gigabyte; 60 percent of that gives\\\\r\\\\none the size of a CD-ROM, which in turn creates a major problem.  One\\\\r\\\\ncannot have full-screen, full-color images with lossless compression; one\\\\r\\\\nmust compress them or use a lower resolution.  For megabyte-size images,\\\\r\\\\nanything slower than a T-1 speed is impractical.  For example, on a\\\\r\\\\nfifty-six-kilobaud line, it takes three minutes to transfer a\\\\r\\\\none-megabyte file, if it is not compressed; and this speed assumes ideal\\\\r\\\\ncircumstances (no other user contending for network bandwidth).  Thus,\\\\r\\\\nquestions of disk access, remote display, and current telephone\\\\r\\\\nconnection speed make transmission of megabyte-size images impractical.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER then discussed ways to deal with these large images, for example,\\\\r\\\\ncompression and decompression at the user\\\\\\'s end.  In this connection, the\\\\r\\\\nissues of how much one is willing to lose in the compression process and\\\\r\\\\nwhat image quality one needs in the first place are unknown.  But what is\\\\r\\\\nknown is that compression entails some loss of data.  BESSER urged that\\\\r\\\\nmore studies be conducted on image quality in different situations, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, what kind of images are needed for what kind of disciplines, and\\\\r\\\\nwhat kind of image quality is needed for a browsing tool, an intermediate\\\\r\\\\nviewing tool, and archiving.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER remarked two promising trends for compression:  from a technical\\\\r\\\\nperspective, algorithms that use what is called subjective redundancy\\\\r\\\\nemploy principles from visual psycho-physics to identify and remove\\\\r\\\\ninformation from the image that the human eye cannot perceive; from an\\\\r\\\\ninterchange and interoperability perspective, the JPEG (i.e., Joint\\\\r\\\\nPhotographic Experts Group, an ISO standard) compression algorithms also\\\\r\\\\noffer promise.  These issues of compression and decompression, BESSER\\\\r\\\\nargued, resembled those raised earlier concerning the design of different\\\\r\\\\nplatforms.  Gauging the capabilities of potential users constitutes a\\\\r\\\\nprimary goal.  BESSER advocated layering or separating the images from\\\\r\\\\nthe applications that retrieve and display them, to avoid tying them to\\\\r\\\\nparticular software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER detailed several lessons learned from his work at Berkeley with\\\\r\\\\nImagequery, especially the advantages and disadvantages of using\\\\r\\\\nX-Windows.  In the latter category, for example, retrieval is tied\\\\r\\\\ndirectly to one\\\\\\'s data, an intolerable situation in the long run on a\\\\r\\\\nnetworked system.  Finally, BESSER described a project of Jim Wallace at\\\\r\\\\nthe Smithsonian Institution, who is mounting images in a extremely\\\\r\\\\nrudimentary way on the Compuserv and Genie networks and is preparing to\\\\r\\\\nmount them on America On Line.  Although the average user takes over\\\\r\\\\nthirty minutes to download these images (assuming a fairly fast modem),\\\\r\\\\nnevertheless, images have been downloaded 25,000 times.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER concluded his talk with several comments on the business\\\\r\\\\narrangement between the Smithsonian and Compuserv.

LESK had heard\\\\r\\\\nthat National Geographic, for example, had tried to buy the right to use\\\\r\\\\nsome image in some kind of educational production for $100 per image, but\\\\r\\\\nthe photographers will not touch it.  They want accounting and payment\\\\r\\\\nfor each use, which cannot be accomplished within the system.  BESSER\\\\r\\\\nresponded that a consortium of photographers, headed by a former National\\\\r\\\\nGeographic photographer, had started assembling its own collection of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic reproductions of images, with the money going back to the\\\\r\\\\ncooperative.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK contended that BESSER was unnecessarily pessimistic about multimedia\\\\r\\\\nimages, because people are accustomed to low-quality images, particularly\\\\r\\\\nfrom video.  BESSER urged the launching of a study to determine what\\\\r\\\\nusers would tolerate, what they would feel comfortable with, and what\\\\r\\\\nabsolutely is the highest quality they would ever need.  Conceding that\\\\r\\\\nhe had adopted a dire tone in order to arouse people about the issue,\\\\r\\\\nBESSER closed on a sanguine note by saying that he would not be in this\\\\r\\\\nbusiness if he did not think that things could be accomplished.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN * Issues of scalability and modularity * Geometric growth of the\\\\r\\\\nInternet and the role played by layering * Basic functions sustaining\\\\r\\\\nthis growth * A library\\\\\\'s roles and functions in a network environment *\\\\r\\\\nEffects of implementation of the Z39.50 protocol for information\\\\r\\\\nretrieval on the library system * The trade-off between volumes of data\\\\r\\\\nand its potential usage * A snapshot of current trends *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRonald LARSEN, associate director for information technology, University\\\\r\\\\nof Maryland at College Park, first addressed the issues of scalability\\\\r\\\\nand modularity.  He noted the difficulty of anticipating the effects of\\\\r\\\\norders-of-magnitude growth, reflecting on the twenty years of experience\\\\r\\\\nwith the Arpanet and Internet.  Recalling the day\\\\\\'s demonstrations of\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM and optical disk material, he went on to ask if the field has yet\\\\r\\\\nlearned how to scale new systems to enable delivery and dissemination\\\\r\\\\nacross large-scale networks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN focused on the geometric growth of the Internet from its inception\\\\r\\\\ncirca 1969 to the present, and the adjustments required to respond to\\\\r\\\\nthat rapid growth.  To illustrate the issue of scalability, LARSEN\\\\r\\\\nconsidered computer networks as including three generic components:\\\\r\\\\ncomputers, network communication nodes, and communication media.  Each\\\\r\\\\ncomponent scales (e.g., computers range from PCs to supercomputers;\\\\r\\\\nnetwork nodes scale from interface cards in a PC through sophisticated\\\\r\\\\nrouters and gateways; and communication media range from 2,400-baud\\\\r\\\\ndial-up facilities through 4.5-Mbps backbone links, and eventually to\\\\r\\\\nmultigigabit-per-second communication lines), and architecturally, the\\\\r\\\\ncomponents are organized to scale hierarchically from local area networks\\\\r\\\\nto international-scale networks.  Such growth is made possible by\\\\r\\\\nbuilding layers of communication protocols, as BESSER pointed out.\\\\r\\\\nBy layering both physically and logically, a sense of scalability is\\\\r\\\\nmaintained from local area networks in offices, across campuses, through\\\\r\\\\nbridges, routers, campus backbones, fiber-optic links, etc., up into\\\\r\\\\nregional networks and ultimately into national and international\\\\r\\\\nnetworks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN then illustrated the geometric growth over a two-year period--\\\\r\\\\nthrough September 1991--of the number of networks that comprise the\\\\r\\\\nInternet.  This growth has been sustained largely by the availability of\\\\r\\\\nthree basic functions:  electronic mail, file transfer (ftp), and remote\\\\r\\\\nlog-on (telnet).  LARSEN also reviewed the growth in the kind of traffic\\\\r\\\\nthat occurs on the network.  Network traffic reflects the joint contributions\\\\r\\\\nof a larger population of users and increasing use per user.  Today one sees\\\\r\\\\nserious applications involving moving images across the network--a rarity\\\\r\\\\nten years ago.  LARSEN recalled and concurred with BESSER\\\\\\'s main point\\\\r\\\\nthat the interesting problems occur at the application level.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN then illustrated a model of a library\\\\\\'s roles and functions in a\\\\r\\\\nnetwork environment.  He noted, in particular, the placement of on-line\\\\r\\\\ncatalogues onto the network and patrons obtaining access to the library\\\\r\\\\nincreasingly through local networks, campus networks, and the Internet.\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN supported LYNCH\\\\\\'s earlier suggestion that we need to address\\\\r\\\\nfundamental questions of networked information in order to build\\\\r\\\\nenvironments that scale in the information sense as well as in the\\\\r\\\\nphysical sense.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN supported the role of the library system as the access point into\\\\r\\\\nthe nation\\\\\\'s electronic collections.  Implementation of the Z39.50\\\\r\\\\nprotocol for information retrieval would make such access practical and\\\\r\\\\nfeasible.  For example, this would enable patrons in Maryland to search\\\\r\\\\nCalifornia libraries, or other libraries around the world that are\\\\r\\\\nconformant with Z39.50 in a manner that is familiar to University of\\\\r\\\\nMaryland patrons.  This client-server model also supports moving beyond\\\\r\\\\nsecondary content into primary content.  (The notion of how one links\\\\r\\\\nfrom secondary content to primary content, LARSEN said, represents a\\\\r\\\\nfundamental problem that requires rigorous thought.)  After noting\\\\r\\\\nnumerous network experiments in accessing full-text materials, including\\\\r\\\\nprojects supporting the ordering of materials across the network, LARSEN\\\\r\\\\nrevisited the issue of transmitting high-density, high-resolution color\\\\r\\\\nimages across the network and the large amounts of bandwidth they\\\\r\\\\nrequire.  He went on to address the bandwidth and synchronization\\\\r\\\\nproblems inherent in sending full-motion video across the network.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN illustrated the trade-off between volumes of data in bytes or\\\\r\\\\norders of magnitude and the potential usage of that data.  He discussed\\\\r\\\\ntransmission rates (particularly, the time it takes to move various forms\\\\r\\\\nof information), and what one could do with a network supporting\\\\r\\\\nmultigigabit-per-second transmission.  At the moment, the network\\\\r\\\\nenvironment includes a composite of data-transmission requirements,\\\\r\\\\nvolumes and forms, going from steady to bursty (high-volume) and from\\\\r\\\\nvery slow to very fast.  This aggregate must be considered in the design,\\\\r\\\\nconstruction, and operation of multigigabyte networks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN\\\\\\'s objective is to use the networks and library systems now being\\\\r\\\\nconstructed to increase access to resources wherever they exist, and\\\\r\\\\nthus, to evolve toward an on-line electronic virtual library.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLARSEN concluded by offering a snapshot of current trends:  continuing\\\\r\\\\ngeometric growth in network capacity and number of users; slower\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment of applications; and glacial development and adoption of\\\\r\\\\nstandards.  The challenge is to design and develop each new application\\\\r\\\\nsystem with network access and scalability in mind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nBROWNRIGG * Access to the Internet cannot be taken for granted * Packet\\\\r\\\\nradio and the development of MELVYL in 1980-81 in the Division of Library\\\\r\\\\nAutomation at the University of California  *  Design criteria for packet\\\\r\\\\nradio * A demonstration project in San Diego and future plans * Spread\\\\r\\\\nspectrum * Frequencies at which the radios will run and plans to\\\\r\\\\nreimplement the WAIS server software in the public domain * Need for an\\\\r\\\\ninfrastructure of radios that do not move around *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEdwin BROWNRIGG, executive director, Memex Research Institute, first\\\\r\\\\npolled the audience in order to seek out regular users of the Internet as\\\\r\\\\nwell as those planning to use it some time in the future.  With nearly\\\\r\\\\neverybody in the room falling into one category or the other, BROWNRIGG\\\\r\\\\nmade a point re access, namely that numerous individuals, especially those\\\\r\\\\nwho use the Internet every day, take for granted their access to it, the\\\\r\\\\nspeeds with which they are connected, and how well it all works.\\\\r\\\\nHowever, as BROWNRIGG discovered between 1987 and 1989 in Australia,\\\\r\\\\nif one wants access to the Internet but cannot afford it or has some\\\\r\\\\nphysical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining access, it can\\\\r\\\\nbe extremely frustrating.  He suggested that because of economics and\\\\r\\\\nphysical barriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and have-nots\\\\r\\\\nin the process of scholarly communication, even in the United States.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBROWNRIGG detailed the development of MELVYL in academic year 1980-81 in\\\\r\\\\nthe Division of Library Automation at the University of California, in\\\\r\\\\norder to underscore the issue of access to the system, which at the\\\\r\\\\noutset was extremely limited.  In short, the project needed to build a\\\\r\\\\nnetwork, which at that time entailed use of satellite technology, that is,\\\\r\\\\nputting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links\\\\r\\\\nfrom the State of California\\\\\\'s microwave system.  The installation of\\\\r\\\\nsatellite links, however, did not solve the problem (which actually\\\\r\\\\nformed part of a larger problem involving politics and financial resources).\\\\r\\\\nFor while the project team could get a signal onto a campus, it had no means\\\\r\\\\nof distributing the signal throughout the campus.  The solution involved\\\\r\\\\nadopting a recent development in wireless communication called packet radio,\\\\r\\\\nwhich combined the basic notion of packet-switching with radio.  The project\\\\r\\\\nused this technology to get the signal from a point on campus where it\\\\r\\\\ncame down, an earth station for example, into the libraries, because it\\\\r\\\\nfound that wiring the libraries, especially the older marble buildings,\\\\r\\\\nwould cost $2,000-$5,000 per terminal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBROWNRIGG noted that, ten years ago, the project had neither the public\\\\r\\\\npolicy nor the technology that would have allowed it to use packet radio\\\\r\\\\nin any meaningful way.  Since then much had changed.  He proceeded to\\\\r\\\\ndetail research and development of the technology, how it is being\\\\r\\\\ndeployed in California, and what direction he thought it would take.\\\\r\\\\nThe design criteria are to produce a high-speed, one-time, low-cost,\\\\r\\\\nhigh-quality, secure, license-free device (packet radio) that one can\\\\r\\\\nplug in and play today, forget about it, and have access to the Internet.\\\\r\\\\nBy high speed, BROWNRIGG meant 1 megabyte and 1.5 megabytes.  Those units\\\\r\\\\nhave been built, he continued, and are in the process of being\\\\r\\\\ntype-certified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can\\\\r\\\\nbe type-licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.  As is the\\\\r\\\\ncase with citizens band, one will be able to purchase a unit and not have\\\\r\\\\nto worry about applying for a license.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe basic idea, BROWNRIGG elaborated, is to take high-speed radio data\\\\r\\\\ntransmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic\\\\r\\\\npoints in the network will \"gateway\" into a medium-speed packet radio\\\\r\\\\n(i.e., one that runs at 38.4 kilobytes), so that perhaps by 1994-1995\\\\r\\\\npeople, like those in the audience for the price of a VCR could purchase\\\\r\\\\na medium-speed radio for the office or home, have full network connectivity\\\\r\\\\nto the Internet, and partake of all its services, with no need for an FCC\\\\r\\\\nlicense and no regular bill from the local common carrier.  BROWNRIGG\\\\r\\\\npresented several details of a demonstration project currently taking\\\\r\\\\nplace in San Diego and described plans, pending funding, to install a\\\\r\\\\nfull-bore network in the San Francisco area.  This network will have 600\\\\r\\\\nnodes running at backbone speeds, and 100 of these nodes will be libraries,\\\\r\\\\nwhich in turn will be the gateway ports to the 38.4 kilobyte radios that\\\\r\\\\nwill give coverage for the neighborhoods surrounding the libraries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBROWNRIGG next explained Part 15.247, a new rule within Title 47 of the\\\\r\\\\nCode of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in 1985.  This rule\\\\r\\\\nchallenged the industry, which has only now risen to the occasion, to\\\\r\\\\nbuild a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and\\\\r\\\\nuse a fairly exotic method of modulating the radio wave called spread\\\\r\\\\nspectrum.  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of networks so\\\\r\\\\nthat numerous data communications can occur simultaneously, without\\\\r\\\\ninterfering with each other, within the same wide radio channel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBROWNRIGG explained that the frequencies at which the radios would run\\\\r\\\\nare very short wave signals.  They are well above standard microwave and\\\\r\\\\nradar.  With a radio wave that small, one watt becomes a tremendous punch\\\\r\\\\nper bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible.  In\\\\r\\\\norder to minimize the potential for congestion, the project is\\\\r\\\\nundertaking to reimplement software which has been available in the\\\\r\\\\nnetworking business and is taken for granted now, for example, TCP/IP,\\\\r\\\\nrouting algorithms, bridges, and gateways.  In addition, the project\\\\r\\\\nplans to take the WAIS server software in the public domain and\\\\r\\\\nreimplement it so that one can have a WAIS server on a Mac instead of a\\\\r\\\\nUnix machine.  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries, in\\\\r\\\\nparticular, will want to use the WAIS servers with packet radio.  This\\\\r\\\\nproject, which has a team of about twelve people, will run through 1993\\\\r\\\\nand will include the 100 libraries already mentioned as well as other\\\\r\\\\nprofessionals such as those in the medical profession, engineering, and\\\\r\\\\nlaw.  Thus, the need is to create an infrastructure of radios that do not\\\\r\\\\nmove around, which, BROWNRIGG hopes, will solve a problem not only for\\\\r\\\\nlibraries but for individuals who, by and large today, do not have access\\\\r\\\\nto the Internet from their homes and offices.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Project operating frequencies *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring a brief discussion period, which also concluded the day\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nproceedings, BROWNRIGG stated that the project was operating in four\\\\r\\\\nfrequencies.  The slow speed is operating at 435 megahertz, and it would\\\\r\\\\nlater go up to 920 megahertz.  With the high-speed frequency, the\\\\r\\\\none-megabyte radios will run at 2.4 gigabits, and 1.5 will run at 5.7.\\\\r\\\\nAt 5.7, rain can be a factor, but it would have to be tropical rain,\\\\r\\\\nunlike what falls in most parts of the United States.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION IV.

She described three factors that influenced development of\\\\r\\\\nthe project:  1) Because the project has emphasized the preservation of\\\\r\\\\ndeteriorating brittle books, the quality of what was produced had to be\\\\r\\\\nsufficiently high to return a paper replacement to the shelf.  CXP was\\\\r\\\\nonly interested in using:  2) a system that was cost-effective, which\\\\r\\\\nmeant that it had to be cost-competitive with the processes currently\\\\r\\\\navailable, principally photocopy and microfilm, and 3) new or currently\\\\r\\\\navailable product hardware and software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY described the advantages that using digital technology offers over\\\\r\\\\nboth photocopy and microfilm:  1) The potential exists to create a higher\\\\r\\\\nquality reproduction of a deteriorating original than conventional\\\\r\\\\nlight-lens technology.  2) Because a digital image is an encoded\\\\r\\\\nrepresentation, it can be reproduced again and again with no resulting\\\\r\\\\nloss of quality, as opposed to the situation with light-lens processes,\\\\r\\\\nin which there is discernible difference between a second and a\\\\r\\\\nsubsequent generation of an image.  3) A digital image can be manipulated\\\\r\\\\nin a number of ways to improve image capture; for example, Xerox has\\\\r\\\\ndeveloped a windowing application that enables one to capture a page\\\\r\\\\ncontaining both text and illustrations in a manner that optimizes the\\\\r\\\\nreproduction of both.  (With light-lens technology, one must choose which\\\\r\\\\nto optimize, text or the illustration; in preservation microfilming, the\\\\r\\\\ncurrent practice is to shoot an illustrated page twice, once to highlight\\\\r\\\\nthe text and the second time to provide the best capture for the\\\\r\\\\nillustration.)  4) A digital image can also be edited, density levels\\\\r\\\\nadjusted to remove underlining and stains, and to increase legibility for\\\\r\\\\nfaint documents.  5) On-screen inspection can take place at the time of\\\\r\\\\ninitial setup and adjustments made prior to scanning, factors that\\\\r\\\\nsubstantially reduce the number of retakes required in quality control.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA primary goal of CXP has been to evaluate the paper output printed on\\\\r\\\\nthe Xerox DocuTech, a high-speed printer that produces 600-dpi pages from\\\\r\\\\nscanned images at a rate of 135 pages a minute.  KENNEY recounted several\\\\r\\\\npublishing challenges to represent faithful and legible reproductions of\\\\r\\\\nthe originals that the 600-dpi copy for the most part successfully\\\\r\\\\ncaptured.  For example, many of the deteriorating volumes in the project\\\\r\\\\nwere heavily illustrated with fine line drawings or halftones or came in\\\\r\\\\nlanguages such as Japanese, in which the buildup of characters comprised\\\\r\\\\nof varying strokes is difficult to reproduce at lower resolutions; a\\\\r\\\\nsurprising number of them came with annotations and mathematical\\\\r\\\\nformulas, which it was critical to be able to duplicate exactly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY noted that 1) the copies are being printed on paper that meets the\\\\r\\\\nANSI standards for performance, 2) the DocuTech printer meets the machine\\\\r\\\\nand toner requirements for proper adhesion of print to page, as described\\\\r\\\\nby the National Archives, and thus 3) paper product is considered to be\\\\r\\\\nthe archival equivalent of preservation photocopy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY then discussed several samples of the quality achieved in the\\\\r\\\\nproject that had been distributed in a handout, for example, a copy of a\\\\r\\\\nprint-on-demand version of the 1911 Reed lecture on the steam turbine,\\\\r\\\\nwhich contains halftones, line drawings, and illustrations embedded in\\\\r\\\\ntext; the first four loose pages in the volume compared the capture\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities of scanning to photocopy for a standard test target, the\\\\r\\\\nIEEE standard 167A 1987 test chart.  In all instances scanning proved\\\\r\\\\nsuperior to photocopy, though only slightly more so in one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConceding the simplistic nature of her review of the quality of scanning\\\\r\\\\nto photocopy, KENNEY described it as one representation of the kinds of\\\\r\\\\nsettings that could be used with scanning capabilities on the equipment\\\\r\\\\nCXP uses.  KENNEY also pointed out that CXP investigated the quality\\\\r\\\\nachieved with binary scanning only, and noted the great promise in gray\\\\r\\\\nscale and color scanning, whose advantages and disadvantages need to be\\\\r\\\\nexamined.  She argued further that scanning resolutions and file formats\\\\r\\\\ncan represent a complex trade-off between the time it takes to capture\\\\r\\\\nmaterial, file size, fidelity to the original, and on-screen display; and\\\\r\\\\nprinting and equipment availability.  All these factors must be taken\\\\r\\\\ninto consideration.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCXP placed primary emphasis on the production in a timely and\\\\r\\\\ncost-effective manner of printed facsimiles that consisted largely of\\\\r\\\\nblack-and-white text.  With binary scanning, large files may be\\\\r\\\\ncompressed efficiently and in a lossless manner (i.e., no data is lost in\\\\r\\\\nthe process of compressing [and decompressing] an image--the exact\\\\r\\\\nbit-representation is maintained) using Group 4 CCITT (i.e., the French\\\\r\\\\nacronym for International Consultative Committee for Telegraph and\\\\r\\\\nTelephone) compression.  CXP was getting compression ratios of about\\\\r\\\\nforty to one.  Gray-scale compression, which primarily uses JPEG, is much\\\\r\\\\nless economical and can represent a lossy compression (i.e., not\\\\r\\\\nlossless), so that as one compresses and decompresses, the illustration\\\\r\\\\nis subtly changed.  While binary files produce a high-quality printed\\\\r\\\\nversion, it appears 1) that other combinations of spatial resolution with\\\\r\\\\ngray and/or color hold great promise as well, and 2) that gray scale can\\\\r\\\\nrepresent a tremendous advantage for on-screen viewing.  The quality\\\\r\\\\nassociated with binary and gray scale also depends on the equipment used.\\\\r\\\\nFor instance, binary scanning produces a much better copy on a binary\\\\r\\\\nprinter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong CXP\\\\\\'s findings concerning the production of microfilm from digital\\\\r\\\\nfiles, KENNEY reported that the digital files for the same Reed lecture\\\\r\\\\nwere used to produce sample film using an electron beam recorder.  The\\\\r\\\\nresulting film was faithful to the image capture of the digital files,\\\\r\\\\nand while CXP felt that the text and image pages represented in the Reed\\\\r\\\\nlecture were superior to that of the light-lens film, the resolution\\\\r\\\\nreadings for the 600 dpi were not as high as standard microfilming.\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY argued that the standards defined for light-lens technology are\\\\r\\\\nnot totally transferable to a digital environment.  Moreover, they are\\\\r\\\\nbased on definition of quality for a preservation copy.  Although making\\\\r\\\\nthis case will prove to be a long, uphill struggle, CXP plans to continue\\\\r\\\\nto investigate the issue over the course of the next year.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY concluded this portion of her talk with a discussion of the\\\\r\\\\nadvantages of creating film:  it can serve as a primary backup and as a\\\\r\\\\npreservation master to the digital file; it could then become the print\\\\r\\\\nor production master and service copies could be paper, film, optical\\\\r\\\\ndisks, magnetic media, or on-screen display.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally, KENNEY presented details re production:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Development and testing of a moderately-high resolution production\\\\r\\\\n     scanning workstation represented a third goal of CXP; to date, 1,000\\\\r\\\\n     volumes have been scanned, or about 300,000 images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The resulting digital files are stored and used to produce\\\\r\\\\n     hard-copy replacements for the originals and additional prints on\\\\r\\\\n     demand; although the initial costs are high, scanning technology\\\\r\\\\n     offers an affordable means for reformatting brittle material.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * A technician in production mode can scan 300 pages per hour when\\\\r\\\\n     performing single-sheet scanning, which is a necessity when working\\\\r\\\\n     with truly brittle paper; this figure is expected to increase\\\\r\\\\n     significantly with subsequent iterations of the software from Xerox;\\\\r\\\\n     a three-month time-and-cost study of scanning found that the average\\\\r\\\\n     300-page book would take about an hour and forty minutes to scan\\\\r\\\\n     (this figure included the time for setup, which involves keying in\\\\r\\\\n     primary bibliographic data, going into quality control mode to\\\\r\\\\n     define page size, establishing front-to-back registration, and\\\\r\\\\n     scanning sample pages to identify a default range of settings for\\\\r\\\\n     the entire book--functions not dissimilar to those performed by\\\\r\\\\n     filmers or those preparing a book for photocopy).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The final step in the scanning process involved rescans, which\\\\r\\\\n     happily were few and far between, representing well under 1 percent\\\\r\\\\n     of the total pages scanned.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn addition to technician time, CXP costed out equipment, amortized over\\\\r\\\\nfour years, the cost of storing and refreshing the digital files every\\\\r\\\\nfour years, and the cost of printing and binding, book-cloth binding, a\\\\r\\\\npaper reproduction.  The total amounted to a little under $65 per single\\\\r\\\\n300-page volume, with 30 percent overhead included--a figure competitive\\\\r\\\\nwith the prices currently charged by photocopy vendors.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOf course, with scanning, in addition to the paper facsimile, one is left\\\\r\\\\nwith a digital file from which subsequent copies of the book can be\\\\r\\\\nproduced for a fraction of the cost of photocopy, with readers afforded\\\\r\\\\nchoices in the form of these copies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY concluded that digital technology offers an electronic means for a\\\\r\\\\nlibrary preservation effort to pay for itself.  If a brittle-book program\\\\r\\\\nincluded the means of disseminating reprints of books that are in demand\\\\r\\\\nby libraries and researchers alike, the initial investment in capture\\\\r\\\\ncould be recovered and used to preserve additional but less popular\\\\r\\\\nbooks.  She disclosed that an economic model for a self-sustaining\\\\r\\\\nprogram could be developed for CXP\\\\\\'s report to the Commission on\\\\r\\\\nPreservation and Access (CPA).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKENNEY stressed that the focus of CXP has been on obtaining high quality\\\\r\\\\nin a production environment.  The use of digital technology is viewed as\\\\r\\\\nan affordable alternative to other reformatting options.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nANDRE * Overview and history of NATDP * Various agricultural CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\nproducts created inhouse and by service bureaus * Pilot project on\\\\r\\\\nInternet transmission * Additional products in progress *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPamela ANDRE, associate director for automation, National Agricultural\\\\r\\\\nText Digitizing Program (NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL),\\\\r\\\\npresented an overview of NATDP, which has been underway at NAL the last\\\\r\\\\nfour years, before Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  ANDRE\\\\r\\\\ndefined agricultural information as a broad range of material going from\\\\r\\\\nbasic and applied research in the hard sciences to the one-page pamphlets\\\\r\\\\nthat are distributed by the cooperative state extension services on such\\\\r\\\\nthings as how to grow blueberries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNATDP began in late 1986 with a meeting of representatives from the\\\\r\\\\nland-grant library community to deal with the issue of electronic\\\\r\\\\ninformation.  NAL and forty-five of these libraries banded together to\\\\r\\\\nestablish this project--to evaluate the technology for converting what\\\\r\\\\nwere then source documents in paper form into electronic form, to provide\\\\r\\\\naccess to that digital information, and then to distribute it.\\\\r\\\\nDistributing that material to the community--the university community as\\\\r\\\\nwell as the extension service community, potentially down to the county\\\\r\\\\nlevel--constituted the group\\\\\\'s chief concern.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSince January 1988 (when the microcomputer-based scanning system was\\\\r\\\\ninstalled at NAL), NATDP has done a variety of things, concerning which\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR would provide further details.  For example, the first technology\\\\r\\\\nconsidered in the project\\\\\\'s discussion phase was digital videodisc, which\\\\r\\\\nindicates how long ago it was conceived.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOver the four years of this project, four separate CD-ROM products on\\\\r\\\\nfour different agricultural topics were created, two at a\\\\r\\\\nscanning-and-OCR station installed at NAL, and two by service bureaus.\\\\r\\\\nThus, NATDP has gained comparative information in terms of those relative\\\\r\\\\ncosts.  Each of these products contained the full ASCII text as well as\\\\r\\\\npage images of the material, or between 4,000 and 6,000 pages of material\\\\r\\\\non these disks.  Topics included aquaculture, food, agriculture and\\\\r\\\\nscience (i.e., international agriculture and research), acid rain, and\\\\r\\\\nAgent Orange, which was the final product distributed (approximately\\\\r\\\\neighteen months before the Workshop).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe third phase of NATDP focused on delivery mechanisms other than\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM.  At the suggestion of Clifford LYNCH, who was a technical\\\\r\\\\nconsultant to the project at this point, NATDP became involved with the\\\\r\\\\nInternet and initiated a project with the help of North Carolina State\\\\r\\\\nUniversity, in which fourteen of the land-grant university libraries are\\\\r\\\\ntransmitting digital images over the Internet in response to interlibrary\\\\r\\\\nloan requests--a topic for another meeting.  At this point, the pilot\\\\r\\\\nproject had been completed for about a year and the final report would be\\\\r\\\\navailable shortly after the Workshop.  In the meantime, the project\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nsuccess had led to its extension.  (ANDRE noted that one of the first\\\\r\\\\nthings done under the program title was to select a retrieval package to\\\\r\\\\nuse with subsequent products; Windows Personal Librarian was the package\\\\r\\\\nof choice after a lengthy evaluation.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree additional products had been planned and were in progress:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     1) An arrangement with the American Society of Agronomy--a\\\\r\\\\n     professional society that has published the Agronomy Journal since\\\\r\\\\n     about 1908--to scan and create bit-mapped images of its journal.\\\\r\\\\n     ASA granted permission first to put and then to distribute this\\\\r\\\\n     material in electronic form, to hold it at NAL, and to use these\\\\r\\\\n     electronic images as a mechanism to deliver documents or print out\\\\r\\\\n     material for patrons, among other uses.  Effectively, NAL has the\\\\r\\\\n     right to use this material in support of its program.\\\\r\\\\n     (Significantly, this arrangement offers a potential cooperative\\\\r\\\\n     model for working with other professional societies in agriculture\\\\r\\\\n     to try to do the same thing--put the journals of particular interest\\\\r\\\\n     to agriculture research into electronic form.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     2) An extension of the earlier product on aquaculture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     3) The George Washington Carver Papers--a joint project with\\\\r\\\\n     Tuskegee University to scan and convert from microfilm some 3,500\\\\r\\\\n     images of Carver\\\\\\'s papers, letters, and drawings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was anticipated that all of these products would appear no more than\\\\r\\\\nsix months after the Workshop.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR * (A separate arena for scanning) * Steps in creating a database *\\\\r\\\\nImage capture, with and without performing OCR * Keying in tracking data\\\\r\\\\n* Scanning, with electronic and manual tracking * Adjustments during\\\\r\\\\nscanning process * Scanning resolutions * Compression * De-skewing and\\\\r\\\\nfiltering * Image capture from microform:  the papers and letters of\\\\r\\\\nGeorge Washington Carver * Equipment used for a scanning system *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJudith ZIDAR, coordinator, National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program\\\\r\\\\n(NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL), illustrated the technical\\\\r\\\\ndetails of NATDP, including her primary responsibility, scanning and\\\\r\\\\ncreating databases on a topic and putting them on CD-ROM.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(ZIDAR remarked a separate arena from the CD-ROM projects, although the\\\\r\\\\nprocessing of the material is nearly identical, in which NATDP is also\\\\r\\\\nscanning material and loading it on a Next microcomputer, which in turn\\\\r\\\\nis linked to NAL\\\\\\'s integrated library system.  Thus, searches in NAL\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nbibliographic database will enable people to pull up actual page images\\\\r\\\\nand text for any documents that have been entered.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn accordance with the session\\\\\\'s topic, ZIDAR focused her illustrated\\\\r\\\\ntalk on image capture, offering a primer on the three main steps in the\\\\r\\\\nprocess:  1) assemble the printed publications; 2) design the database\\\\r\\\\n(database design occurs in the process of preparing the material for\\\\r\\\\nscanning; this step entails reviewing and organizing the material,\\\\r\\\\ndefining the contents--what will constitute a record, what kinds of\\\\r\\\\nfields will be captured in terms of author, title, etc.); 3) perform a\\\\r\\\\ncertain amount of markup on the paper publications.  NAL performs this\\\\r\\\\ntask record by record, preparing work sheets or some other sort of\\\\r\\\\ntracking material and designing descriptors and other enhancements to be\\\\r\\\\nadded to the data that will not be captured from the printed publication.\\\\r\\\\nPart of this process also involves determining NATDP\\\\\\'s file and directory\\\\r\\\\nstructure:  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 100\\\\r\\\\nimages in a directory, because placing more than that on a CD-ROM would\\\\r\\\\nreduce the access speed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis up-front process takes approximately two weeks for a\\\\r\\\\n6,000-7,000-page database.  The next step is to capture the page images.\\\\r\\\\nHow long this process takes is determined by the decision whether or not\\\\r\\\\nto perform OCR.  Not performing OCR speeds the process, whereas text\\\\r\\\\ncapture requires greater care because of the quality of the image:  it\\\\r\\\\nhas to be straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page, not\\\\r\\\\njust for the capture of photographs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNATDP keys in tracking data, that is, a standard bibliographic record\\\\r\\\\nincluding the title of the book and the title of the chapter, which will\\\\r\\\\nlater either become the access information or will be attached to the\\\\r\\\\nfront of a full-text record so that it is searchable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nImages are scanned from a bound or unbound publication, chiefly from\\\\r\\\\nbound publications in the case of NATDP, however, because often they are\\\\r\\\\nthe only copies and the publications are returned to the shelves.  NATDP\\\\r\\\\nusually scans one record at a time, because its database tracking system\\\\r\\\\ntracks the document in that way and does not require further logical\\\\r\\\\nseparating of the images.  After performing optical character\\\\r\\\\nrecognition, NATDP moves the images off the hard disk and maintains a\\\\r\\\\nvolume sheet.  Though the system tracks electronically, all the\\\\r\\\\nprocessing steps are also tracked manually with a log sheet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when\\\\r\\\\nscanning from paper and microfilm, for example, redoing images that need\\\\r\\\\nspecial handling, setting for dithering or gray scale, and adjusting for\\\\r\\\\nbrightness or for the whole book at one time.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNATDP is scanning at 300 dots per inch, a standard scanning resolution.\\\\r\\\\nThough adequate for capturing text that is all of a standard size, 300\\\\r\\\\ndpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material or for very small\\\\r\\\\ntext.  Many scanners allow for different image formats, TIFF, of course,\\\\r\\\\nbeing a de facto standard.  But if one intends to exchange images with\\\\r\\\\nother people, the ability to scan other image formats, even if they are\\\\r\\\\nless common, becomes highly desirable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCCITT Group 4 is the standard compression for normal black-and-white\\\\r\\\\nimages, JPEG for gray scale or color.   ZIDAR recommended 1) using the\\\\r\\\\nstandard compressions, particularly if one attempts to make material\\\\r\\\\navailable and to allow users to download images and reuse them from\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROMs; and 2) maintaining the ability to output an uncompressed image,\\\\r\\\\nbecause in image exchange uncompressed images are more likely to be able\\\\r\\\\nto cross platforms.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR emphasized the importance of de-skewing and filtering as\\\\r\\\\nrequirements on NATDP\\\\\\'s upgraded system.  For instance, scanning bound\\\\r\\\\nbooks, particularly books published by the federal government whose pages\\\\r\\\\nare skewed, and trying to scan them straight if OCR is to be performed,\\\\r\\\\nis extremely time-consuming.  The same holds for filtering of\\\\r\\\\npoor-quality or older materials.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR described image capture from microform, using as an example three\\\\r\\\\nreels from a sixty-seven-reel set of the papers and letters of George\\\\r\\\\nWashington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University.  These\\\\r\\\\nresulted in approximately 3,500 images, which NATDP had had scanned by\\\\r\\\\nits service contractor, Science Applications International Corporation\\\\r\\\\n(SAIC).  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access.  (NATDP did\\\\r\\\\nnot have such specialized equipment as a microfilm scanner.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUnfortunately, the process of scanning from microfilm was not an\\\\r\\\\nunqualified success, ZIDAR reported:  because microfilm frame sizes vary,\\\\r\\\\noccasionally some frames were missed, which without spending much time\\\\r\\\\nand money could not be recaptured.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOCR could not be performed from the scanned images of the frames.  The\\\\r\\\\nbleeding in the text simply output text, when OCR was run, that could not\\\\r\\\\neven be edited.  NATDP tested for negative versus positive images,\\\\r\\\\nlandscape versus portrait orientation, and single- versus dual-page\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm, none of which seemed to affect the quality of the image; but\\\\r\\\\nalso on none of them could OCR be performed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn selecting the microfilm they would use, therefore, NATDP had other\\\\r\\\\nfactors in mind.  ZIDAR noted two factors that influenced the quality of\\\\r\\\\nthe images:  1) the inherent quality of the original and 2) the amount of\\\\r\\\\nsize reduction on the pages.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Carver papers were selected because they are informative and visually\\\\r\\\\ninteresting, treat a single subject, and are valuable in their own right.\\\\r\\\\nThe images were scanned and divided into logical records by SAIC, then\\\\r\\\\ndelivered, and loaded onto NATDP\\\\\\'s system, where bibliographic\\\\r\\\\ninformation taken directly from the images was added.  Scanning was\\\\r\\\\ncompleted in summer 1991 and by the end of summer 1992 the disk was\\\\r\\\\nscheduled to be published.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProblems encountered during processing included the following:  Because\\\\r\\\\nthe microfilm scanning had to be done in a batch, adjustment for\\\\r\\\\nindividual page variations was not possible.  The frame size varied on\\\\r\\\\naccount of the nature of the material, and therefore some of the frames\\\\r\\\\nwere missed while others were just partial frames.  The only way to go\\\\r\\\\nback and capture this material was to print out the page with the\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm reader from the missing frame and then scan it in from the\\\\r\\\\npage, which was extremely time-consuming.  The quality of the images\\\\r\\\\nscanned from the printout of the microfilm compared unfavorably with that\\\\r\\\\nof the original images captured directly from the microfilm.  The\\\\r\\\\ninability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment.  At the time,\\\\r\\\\ncomputer output microfilm was unavailable to test.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed by\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR.  The type of equipment that one would purchase for a scanning\\\\r\\\\nsystem included:  a microcomputer, at least a 386, but preferably a 486;\\\\r\\\\na large hard disk, 380 megabyte at minimum; a multi-tasking operating\\\\r\\\\nsystem that allows one to run some things in batch in the background\\\\r\\\\nwhile scanning or doing text editing, for example, Unix or OS/2 and,\\\\r\\\\ntheoretically, Windows; a high-speed scanner and scanning software that\\\\r\\\\nallows one to make the various adjustments mentioned earlier; a\\\\r\\\\nhigh-resolution monitor (150 dpi ); OCR software and hardware to perform\\\\r\\\\ntext recognition; an optical disk subsystem on which to archive all the\\\\r\\\\nimages as the processing is done; file management and tracking software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR opined that the software one purchases was more important than the\\\\r\\\\nhardware and might also cost more than the hardware, but it was likely to\\\\r\\\\nprove critical to the success or failure of one\\\\\\'s system.  In addition to\\\\r\\\\na stand-alone scanning workstation for image capture, then, text capture\\\\r\\\\nrequires one or two editing stations networked to this scanning station\\\\r\\\\nto perform editing.  Editing the text takes two or three times as long as\\\\r\\\\ncapturing the images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally, ZIDAR stressed the importance of buying an open system that allows\\\\r\\\\nfor more than one vendor, complies with standards, and can be upgraded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nWATERS *Yale University Library\\\\\\'s master plan to convert microfilm to\\\\r\\\\ndigital imagery (POB) * The place of electronic tools in the library of\\\\r\\\\nthe future * The uses of images and an image library * Primary input from\\\\r\\\\npreservation microfilm * Features distinguishing POB from CXP and key\\\\r\\\\nhypotheses guiding POB * Use of vendor selection process to facilitate\\\\r\\\\norganizational work * Criteria for selecting vendor * Finalists and\\\\r\\\\nresults of process for Yale * Key factor distinguishing vendors *\\\\r\\\\nComponents, design principles, and some estimated costs of POB * Role of\\\\r\\\\npreservation materials in developing imaging market * Factors affecting\\\\r\\\\nquality and cost * Factors affecting the usability of complex documents\\\\r\\\\nin image form *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDonald WATERS, head of the Systems Office, Yale University Library,\\\\r\\\\nreported on the progress of a master plan for a project at Yale to\\\\r\\\\nconvert microfilm to digital imagery, Project Open Book (POB).  Stating\\\\r\\\\nthat POB was in an advanced stage of planning, WATERS detailed, in\\\\r\\\\nparticular, the process of selecting a vendor partner and several key\\\\r\\\\nissues under discussion as Yale prepares to move into the project itself.\\\\r\\\\nHe commented first on the vision that serves as the context of POB and\\\\r\\\\nthen described its purpose and scope.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWATERS sees the library of the future not necessarily as an electronic\\\\r\\\\nlibrary but as a place that generates, preserves, and improves for its\\\\r\\\\nclients ready access to both intellectual and physical recorded\\\\r\\\\nknowledge.  Electronic tools must find a place in the library in the\\\\r\\\\ncontext of this vision.  Several roles for electronic tools include\\\\r\\\\nserving as:  indirect sources of electronic knowledge or as \"finding\"\\\\r\\\\naids (the on-line catalogues, the article-level indices, registers for\\\\r\\\\ndocuments and archives); direct sources of recorded knowledge; full-text\\\\r\\\\nimages; and various kinds of compound sources of recorded knowledge (the\\\\r\\\\nso-called compound documents of Hypertext, mixed text and image,\\\\r\\\\nmixed-text image format, and multimedia).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPOB is looking particularly at images and an image library, the uses to\\\\r\\\\nwhich images will be put (e.g., storage, printing, browsing, and then use\\\\r\\\\nas input for other processes), OCR as a subsequent process to image\\\\r\\\\ncapture, or creating an image library, and also possibly generating\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile input will come from a variety of sources, POB is considering\\\\r\\\\nespecially input from preservation microfilm.  A possible outcome is that\\\\r\\\\nthe film and paper which provide the input for the image library\\\\r\\\\neventually may go off into remote storage, and that the image library may\\\\r\\\\nbe the primary access tool.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe purpose and scope of POB focus on imaging.  Though related to CXP,\\\\r\\\\nPOB has two features which distinguish it:  1) scale--conversion of\\\\r\\\\n10,000 volumes into digital image form; and 2) source--conversion from\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm.  Given these features, several key working hypotheses guide\\\\r\\\\nPOB, including:  1) Since POB is using microfilm, it is not concerned with\\\\r\\\\nthe image library as a preservation medium.  2) Digital imagery can improve\\\\r\\\\naccess to recorded knowledge through printing and network distribution at\\\\r\\\\na modest incremental cost of microfilm.  3) Capturing and storing documents\\\\r\\\\nin a digital image form is necessary to further improvements in access.\\\\r\\\\n(POB distinguishes between the imaging, digitizing process and OCR,\\\\r\\\\nwhich at this stage it does not plan to perform.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCurrently in its first or organizational phase, POB found that it could\\\\r\\\\nuse a vendor selection process to facilitate a good deal of the\\\\r\\\\norganizational work (e.g., creating a project team and advisory board,\\\\r\\\\nconfirming the validity of the plan, establishing the cost of the project\\\\r\\\\nand a budget, selecting the materials to convert, and then raising the\\\\r\\\\nnecessary funds).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPOB developed numerous selection criteria, including:  a firm committed\\\\r\\\\nto image-document management, the ability to serve as systems integrator\\\\r\\\\nin a large-scale project over several years, interest in developing the\\\\r\\\\nrequisite software as a standard rather than a custom product, and a\\\\r\\\\nwillingness to invest substantial resources in the project itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTwo vendors, DEC and Xerox, were selected as finalists in October 1991,\\\\r\\\\nand with the support of the Commission on Preservation and Access, each\\\\r\\\\nwas commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the\\\\r\\\\nproject and then to submit a formal proposal for the completion of the\\\\r\\\\nproject, which included a budget and costs. The terms were that POB would\\\\r\\\\npay the loser.  The results for Yale of involving a vendor included:\\\\r\\\\nbroad involvement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low\\\\r\\\\ncost, which may have long-term significance in carrying out the project\\\\r\\\\n(twenty-five to thirty university people are engaged in POB); better\\\\r\\\\nunderstanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets\\\\r\\\\nfor imaging products; a competitive proposal; and a more sophisticated\\\\r\\\\nview of the imaging markets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe most important factor that distinguished the vendors under\\\\r\\\\nconsideration was their identification with the customer.  The size and\\\\r\\\\ninternal complexity of the company also was an important factor.  POB was\\\\r\\\\nlooking at large companies that had substantial resources.  In the end,\\\\r\\\\nthe process generated for Yale two competitive proposals, with Xerox\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nthe clear winner.  WATERS then described the components of the proposal,\\\\r\\\\nthe design principles, and some of the costs estimated for the process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nComponents are essentially four:  a conversion subsystem, a\\\\r\\\\nnetwork-accessible storage subsystem for 10,000 books (and POB expects\\\\r\\\\n200 to 600 dpi storage), browsing stations distributed on the campus\\\\r\\\\nnetwork, and network access to the image printers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong the design principles, POB wanted conversion at the highest\\\\r\\\\npossible resolution.  Assuming TIFF files, TIFF files with Group 4\\\\r\\\\ncompression, TCP/IP, and ethernet network on campus, POB wanted a\\\\r\\\\nclient-server approach with image documents distributed to the\\\\r\\\\nworkstations and made accessible through native workstation interfaces\\\\r\\\\nsuch as Windows.  POB also insisted on a phased approach to\\\\r\\\\nimplementation:  1) a stand-alone, single-user, low-cost entry into the\\\\r\\\\nbusiness with a workstation focused on conversion and allowing POB to\\\\r\\\\nexplore user access; 2) movement into a higher-volume conversion with\\\\r\\\\nnetwork-accessible storage and multiple access stations; and 3) a\\\\r\\\\nhigh-volume conversion, full-capacity storage, and multiple browsing\\\\r\\\\nstations distributed throughout the campus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe costs proposed for start-up assumed the existence of the Yale network\\\\r\\\\nand its two DocuTech image printers.  Other start-up costs are estimated\\\\r\\\\nat $1 million over the three phases.  At the end of the project, the annual\\\\r\\\\noperating costs estimated primarily for the software and hardware proposed\\\\r\\\\ncome to about $60,000, but these exclude costs for labor needed in the\\\\r\\\\nconversion process, network and printer usage, and facilities management.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally, the selection process produced for Yale a more sophisticated\\\\r\\\\nview of the imaging markets:  the management of complex documents in\\\\r\\\\nimage form is not a preservation problem, not a library problem, but a\\\\r\\\\ngeneral problem in a broad, general industry.  Preservation materials are\\\\r\\\\nuseful for developing that market because of the qualities of the\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.  For example, much of it is out of copyright.  The resolution\\\\r\\\\nof key issues such as the quality of scanning and image browsing also\\\\r\\\\nwill affect development of that market.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe technology is readily available but changing rapidly.  In this\\\\r\\\\ncontext of rapid change, several factors affect quality and cost, to\\\\r\\\\nwhich POB intends to pay particular attention, for example, the various\\\\r\\\\nlevels of resolution that can be achieved.  POB believes it can bring\\\\r\\\\nresolution up to 600 dpi, but an interpolation process from 400 to 600 is\\\\r\\\\nmore likely.  The variation quality in microfilm will prove to be a\\\\r\\\\nhighly important factor.  POB may reexamine the standards used to film in\\\\r\\\\nthe first place by looking at this process as a follow-on to microfilming.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther important factors include:  the techniques available to the\\\\r\\\\noperator for handling material, the ways of integrating quality control\\\\r\\\\ninto the digitizing work flow, and a work flow that includes indexing and\\\\r\\\\nstorage.  POB\\\\\\'s requirement was to be able to deal with quality control\\\\r\\\\nat the point of scanning.  Thus, thanks to Xerox, POB anticipates having\\\\r\\\\na mechanism which will allow it not only to scan in batch form, but to\\\\r\\\\nreview the material as it goes through the scanner and control quality\\\\r\\\\nfrom the outset.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe standards for measuring quality and costs depend greatly on the uses\\\\r\\\\nof the material, including subsequent OCR, storage, printing, and\\\\r\\\\nbrowsing.  But especially at issue for POB is the facility for browsing.\\\\r\\\\nThis facility, WATERS said, is perhaps the weakest aspect of imaging\\\\r\\\\ntechnology and the most in need of development.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA variety of factors affect the usability of complex documents in image\\\\r\\\\nform, among them:  1) the ability of the system to handle the full range\\\\r\\\\nof document types, not just monographs but serials, multi-part\\\\r\\\\nmonographs, and manuscripts; 2) the location of the database of record\\\\r\\\\nfor bibliographic information about the image document, which POB wants\\\\r\\\\nto enter once and in the most useful place, the on-line catalog; 3) a\\\\r\\\\ndocument identifier for referencing the bibliographic information in one\\\\r\\\\nplace and the images in another; 4) the technique for making the basic\\\\r\\\\ninternal structure of the document accessible to the reader; and finally,\\\\r\\\\n5) the physical presentation on the CRT of those documents.  POB is ready\\\\r\\\\nto complete this phase now.  One last decision involves deciding which\\\\r\\\\nmaterial to scan.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * TIFF files constitute de facto standard * NARA\\\\\\'s experience\\\\r\\\\nwith image conversion software and text conversion * RFC 1314 *\\\\r\\\\nConsiderable flux concerning available hardware and software solutions *\\\\r\\\\nNAL through-put rate during scanning * Window management questions *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the question-and-answer period that followed WATERS\\\\\\'s presentation,\\\\r\\\\nthe following points emerged:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * ZIDAR\\\\\\'s statement about using TIFF files as a standard meant de\\\\r\\\\n     facto standard.  This is what most people use and typically exchange\\\\r\\\\n     with other groups, across platforms, or even occasionally across\\\\r\\\\n     display software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * HOLMES commented on the unsuccessful experience of NARA in\\\\r\\\\n     attempting to run image-conversion software or to exchange between\\\\r\\\\n     applications:  What are supposedly TIFF files go into other software\\\\r\\\\n     that is supposed to be able to accept TIFF but cannot recognize the\\\\r\\\\n     format and cannot deal with it, and thus renders the exchange\\\\r\\\\n     useless.  Re text conversion, he noted the different recognition\\\\r\\\\n     rates obtained by substituting the make and model of scanners in\\\\r\\\\n     NARA\\\\\\'s recent test of an \"intelligent\" character-recognition product\\\\r\\\\n     for a new company.  In the selection of hardware and software,\\\\r\\\\n     HOLMES argued, software no longer constitutes the overriding factor\\\\r\\\\n     it did until about a year ago; rather it is perhaps important to\\\\r\\\\n     look at both now.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Danny Cohen and Alan Katz of the University of Southern California\\\\r\\\\n     Information Sciences Institute began circulating as an Internet RFC\\\\r\\\\n     (RFC 1314) about a month ago a standard for a TIFF interchange\\\\r\\\\n     format for Internet distribution of monochrome bit-mapped images,\\\\r\\\\n     which LYNCH said he believed would be used as a de facto standard.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * FLEISCHHAUER\\\\\\'s impression from hearing these reports and thinking\\\\r\\\\n     about AM\\\\\\'s experience was that there is considerable flux concerning\\\\r\\\\n     available hardware and software solutions.  HOOTON agreed and\\\\r\\\\n     commented at the same time on ZIDAR\\\\\\'s statement that the equipment\\\\r\\\\n     employed affects the results produced.  One cannot draw a complete\\\\r\\\\n     conclusion by saying it is difficult or impossible to perform OCR\\\\r\\\\n     from scanning microfilm, for example, with that device,  that set of\\\\r\\\\n     parameters, and system requirements, because numerous other people\\\\r\\\\n     are accomplishing just that, using other components, perhaps.\\\\r\\\\n     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly\\\\r\\\\n     important.  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in\\\\r\\\\n     numerous different ways by other people.  Though it is good to be\\\\r\\\\n     cognizant of various experiences, this is not to say that it will\\\\r\\\\n     always be thus.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * At NAL, the through-put rate of the scanning process for paper,\\\\r\\\\n     page by page, performing OCR, ranges from 300 to 600 pages per day;\\\\r\\\\n     not performing OCR is considerably faster, although how much faster\\\\r\\\\n     is not known.  This is for scanning from bound books, which is much\\\\r\\\\n     slower.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * WATERS commented on window management questions:  DEC proposed an\\\\r\\\\n     X-Windows solution which was problematical for two reasons.  One was\\\\r\\\\n     POB\\\\\\'s requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation\\\\r\\\\n     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was\\\\r\\\\n     network usage.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA * Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process *\\\\r\\\\nImage quality in this process * Different costs entailed by better image\\\\r\\\\nquality * Techniques for overcoming various de-ficiencies:  fixed\\\\r\\\\nthresholding, dynamic thresholding, dithering, image merge * Page edge\\\\r\\\\neffects *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeorge THOMA, chief, Communications Engineering Branch, National Library\\\\r\\\\nof Medicine (NLM), illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by\\\\r\\\\nthe previous speakers.  He introduced the topic of special problems by\\\\r\\\\nnoting the advantages of electronic imaging.  For example, it is regenerable\\\\r\\\\nbecause it is a coded file, and real-time quality control is possible with\\\\r\\\\nelectronic capture, whereas in photographic capture it is not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was\\\\r\\\\nimage quality which, without belaboring the obvious, means different\\\\r\\\\nthings for maps, medical X-rays, or broadcast television.  In the case of\\\\r\\\\ndocuments, THOMA said, image quality boils down to legibility of the\\\\r\\\\ntextual parts, and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo print-type\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.  Legibility boils down to scan density, the standard in most\\\\r\\\\ncases being 300 dpi.  Increasing the resolution with scanners that\\\\r\\\\nperform 600 or 1200 dpi, however, comes at a cost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBetter image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs:  1)\\\\r\\\\nequipment costs, because the CCD (i.e., charge-couple device) with\\\\r\\\\ngreater number of elements costs more;  2) time costs that translate to\\\\r\\\\nthe actual capture costs, because manual labor is involved (the time is\\\\r\\\\nalso dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the\\\\r\\\\nmachine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as\\\\r\\\\nwell as the storage);  3) media costs, because at high resolutions larger\\\\r\\\\nfiles have to be stored; and 4) transmission costs, because there is just\\\\r\\\\nmore data to be transmitted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image\\\\r\\\\nquality, other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the\\\\r\\\\npage scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified.  Thus,\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies, how they are\\\\r\\\\nmanifested, and several techniques to overcome them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFixed thresholding was the first technique described, suitable for\\\\r\\\\nblack-and-white text, when the contrast does not vary over the page.  One\\\\r\\\\ncan have many different threshold levels in scanning devices.  Thus,\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast, which resulted from\\\\r\\\\nthe fact that the stock was a heavy red.  This is the sort of image that\\\\r\\\\nwhen microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever.  Fixed\\\\r\\\\nthresholding is the way to change the black-to-red contrast to the\\\\r\\\\ndesired black-to-white contrast.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOther examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by\\\\r\\\\nage.  This was also a case of contrast deficiency, and correction was\\\\r\\\\ndone by fixed thresholding.  A final example boils down to the same\\\\r\\\\nthing, slight variability, but it is not significant.  Fixed thresholding\\\\r\\\\nsolves this problem as well.  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible,\\\\r\\\\nbut it comes with dark areas.  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm in this case, he did show the reproduced electronic image.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page\\\\r\\\\narea varies, especially in the case where a bound volume has light\\\\r\\\\nshining on it, the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding\\\\r\\\\nscheme.  One scheme, dynamic averaging, allows the threshold level not to\\\\r\\\\nbe fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring\\\\r\\\\ncharacteristics.  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold\\\\r\\\\nshould be set for that pixel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a\\\\r\\\\nvariety of techniques, including a burn mark, coffee stains, and a yellow\\\\r\\\\nmarker.  Application of a fixed-thresholding scheme, THOMA argued, might\\\\r\\\\ntake care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them.\\\\r\\\\nPerforming the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting, however,\\\\r\\\\nremoves most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnother problem is representing a gray level with black-and-white pixels\\\\r\\\\nby a process known as dithering or electronic screening.  But dithering\\\\r\\\\ndoes not provide good image quality for pure black-and-white textual\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.  THOMA illustrated this point with examples. Although its\\\\r\\\\nsuitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or\\\\r\\\\ndithering, it cannot be used for every compound image.  In the document\\\\r\\\\nthat was distributed by CXP, THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the\\\\r\\\\nIEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text.  He presented an\\\\r\\\\nextreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded\\\\r\\\\ndocuments had to be set right by other techniques.  The technique\\\\r\\\\nillustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page\\\\r\\\\nis scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threshold to the\\\\r\\\\ndithering matrix; the resulting images are merged to give the best\\\\r\\\\nresults with each technique.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA illustrated how dithering is also used in nonphotographic or\\\\r\\\\nnonprint materials with an example of a grayish page from a medical text,\\\\r\\\\nwhich was reproduced to show all of the gray that appeared in the\\\\r\\\\noriginal.  Dithering provided a reproduction of all the gray in the\\\\r\\\\noriginal of another example from the same text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTHOMA finally illustrated the problem of bordering, or page-edge,\\\\r\\\\neffects.  Books and bound volumes that are placed on a photocopy machine\\\\r\\\\nor a scanner produce page-edge effects that are undesirable for two\\\\r\\\\nreasons:  1) the aesthetics of the image; after all, if the image is to\\\\r\\\\nbe preserved, one does not necessarily want to keep all of its\\\\r\\\\ndeficiencies; 2) compression (with the bordering problem THOMA\\\\r\\\\nillustrated, the compression ratio deteriorated tremendously).  One way\\\\r\\\\nto eliminate this more serious problem is to have the operator at the\\\\r\\\\npoint of scanning window the part of the image that is desirable and\\\\r\\\\nautomatically turn all of the pixels out of that picture to white.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER * AM\\\\\\'s experience with scanning bound materials * Dithering\\\\r\\\\n*\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCarl FLEISCHHAUER, coordinator, American Memory, Library of Congress,\\\\r\\\\nreported AM\\\\\\'s experience with scanning bound materials, which he likened\\\\r\\\\nto the problems involved in using photocopying machines.  Very few\\\\r\\\\ndevices in the industry offer book-edge scanning, let alone book cradles.\\\\r\\\\nThe problem may be unsolvable, FLEISCHHAUER said, because a large enough\\\\r\\\\nmarket does not exist for a preservation-quality scanner.  AM is using a\\\\r\\\\nKurzweil scanner, which is a book-edge scanner now sold by Xerox.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDevoting the remainder of his brief presentation to dithering,\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER related AM\\\\\\'s experience with a contractor who was using\\\\r\\\\nunsophisticated equipment and software to reduce moire patterns from\\\\r\\\\nprinted halftones.  AM took the same image and used the dithering\\\\r\\\\nalgorithm that forms part of the same Kurzweil Xerox scanner; it\\\\r\\\\ndisguised moire patterns much more effectively.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER also observed that dithering produces a binary file which is\\\\r\\\\nuseful for numerous purposes, for example, printing it on a laser printer\\\\r\\\\nwithout having to \"re-halftone\" it.  But it tends to defeat efficient\\\\r\\\\ncompression, because the very thing that dithers to reduce moire patterns\\\\r\\\\nalso tends to work against compression schemes.  AM thought the\\\\r\\\\ndifference in image quality was worth it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Relative use as a criterion for POB\\\\\\'s selection of books to\\\\r\\\\nbe converted into digital form *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the discussion period, WATERS noted that one of the criteria for\\\\r\\\\nselecting books among the 10,000 to be converted into digital image form\\\\r\\\\nwould be how much relative use they would receive--a subject still\\\\r\\\\nrequiring evaluation.  The challenge will be to understand whether\\\\r\\\\ncoherent bodies of material will increase usage or whether POB should\\\\r\\\\nseek material that is being used, scan that, and make it more accessible.\\\\r\\\\nPOB might decide to digitize materials that are already heavily used, in\\\\r\\\\norder to make them more accessible and decrease wear on them.  Another\\\\r\\\\napproach would be to provide a large body of intellectually coherent\\\\r\\\\nmaterial that may be used more in digital form than it is currently used\\\\r\\\\nin microfilm.  POB would seek material that was out of copyright.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS * Origin and scope of AIIM * Types of documents produced in\\\\r\\\\nAIIM\\\\\\'s standards program * Domain of AIIM\\\\\\'s standardization work * AIIM\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nstructure * TC 171 and MS23 * Electronic image management standards *\\\\r\\\\nCategories of EIM standardization where AIIM standards are being\\\\r\\\\ndeveloped *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJean BARONAS, senior manager, Department of Standards and Technology,\\\\r\\\\nAssociation for Information and Image Management (AIIM), described the\\\\r\\\\nnot-for-profit association and the national and international programs\\\\r\\\\nfor standardization in which AIIM is active.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAccredited for twenty-five years as the nation\\\\\\'s standards development\\\\r\\\\norganization for document image management, AIIM began life in a library\\\\r\\\\ncommunity developing microfilm standards.  Today the association\\\\r\\\\nmaintains both its library and business-image management standardization\\\\r\\\\nactivities--and has moved into electronic image-management\\\\r\\\\nstandardization (EIM).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS defined the program\\\\\\'s scope.  AIIM deals with:  1) the\\\\r\\\\nterminology of standards and of the technology it uses; 2) methods of\\\\r\\\\nmeasurement for the systems, as well as quality; 3) methodologies for\\\\r\\\\nusers to evaluate and measure quality; 4) the features of apparatus used\\\\r\\\\nto manage and edit images; and 5) the procedures used to manage images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS noted that three types of documents are produced in the AIIM\\\\r\\\\nstandards program:  the first two, accredited by the American National\\\\r\\\\nStandards Institute (ANSI), are standards and standard recommended\\\\r\\\\npractices.  Recommended practices differ from standards in that they\\\\r\\\\ncontain more tutorial information.  A technical report is not an ANSI\\\\r\\\\nstandard.  Because AIIM\\\\\\'s policies and procedures for developing\\\\r\\\\nstandards are approved by ANSI, its standards are labeled ANSI/AIIM,\\\\r\\\\nfollowed by the number and title of the standard.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS then illustrated the domain of AIIM\\\\\\'s standardization work.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample, AIIM is the administrator of the U.S. Technical Advisory Group\\\\r\\\\n(TAG) to the International Standards Organization\\\\\\'s (ISO) technical\\\\r\\\\ncommittee, TC l7l Micrographics and Optical Memories for Document and\\\\r\\\\nImage Recording, Storage, and Use.  AIIM officially works through ANSI in\\\\r\\\\nthe international standardization process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS described AIIM\\\\\\'s structure, including its board of directors, its\\\\r\\\\nstandards board of twelve individuals active in the image-management\\\\r\\\\nindustry, its strategic planning and legal admissibility task forces, and\\\\r\\\\nits National Standards Council, which is comprised of the members of a\\\\r\\\\nnumber of organizations who vote on every AIIM standard before it is\\\\r\\\\npublished.  BARONAS pointed out that AIIM\\\\\\'s liaisons deal with numerous\\\\r\\\\nother standards developers, including the optical disk community, office\\\\r\\\\nand publishing systems, image-codes-and-character set committees, and the\\\\r\\\\nNational Information Standards Organization (NISO).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS illustrated the procedures of TC l7l, which covers all aspects of\\\\r\\\\nimage management.  When AIIM\\\\\\'s national program has conceptualized a new\\\\r\\\\nproject, it is usually submitted to the international level, so that the\\\\r\\\\nmember countries of TC l7l can simultaneously work on the development of\\\\r\\\\nthe standard or the technical report.  BARONAS also illustrated a classic\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm standard, MS23, which deals with numerous imaging concepts that\\\\r\\\\napply to electronic imaging.  Originally developed in the l970s, revised\\\\r\\\\nin the l980s, and revised again in l991, this standard is scheduled for\\\\r\\\\nanother revision.  MS23 is an active standard whereby users may propose\\\\r\\\\nnew density ranges and new methods of evaluating film images in the\\\\r\\\\nstandard\\\\\\'s revision.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS detailed several electronic image-management standards, for\\\\r\\\\ninstance, ANSI/AIIM MS44, a quality-control guideline for scanning 8.5\"\\\\r\\\\nby 11\" black-and-white office documents.  This standard is used with the\\\\r\\\\nIEEE fax image--a continuous tone photographic image with gray scales,\\\\r\\\\ntext, and several continuous tone pictures--and AIIM test target number\\\\r\\\\n2, a representative document used in office document management.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS next outlined the four categories of EIM standardization in which\\\\r\\\\nAIIM standards are being developed:  transfer and retrieval, evaluation,\\\\r\\\\noptical disc and document scanning applications, and design and\\\\r\\\\nconversion of documents.  She detailed several of the main projects of\\\\r\\\\neach:  1) in the category of image transfer and retrieval, a bi-level\\\\r\\\\nimage transfer format, ANSI/AIIM MS53, which is a proposed standard that\\\\r\\\\ndescribes a file header for image transfer between unlike systems when\\\\r\\\\nthe images are compressed using G3 and G4 compression; 2) the category of\\\\r\\\\nimage evaluation, which includes the AIIM-proposed TR26 tutorial on image\\\\r\\\\nresolution (this technical report will treat the differences and\\\\r\\\\nsimilarities between classical or photographic and electronic imaging);\\\\r\\\\n3) design and conversion, which includes a proposed technical report\\\\r\\\\ncalled \"Forms Design Optimization for EIM\" (this report considers how\\\\r\\\\ngeneral-purpose business forms can be best designed so that scanning is\\\\r\\\\noptimized; reprographic characteristics such as type, rules, background,\\\\r\\\\ntint, and color will likewise be treated in the technical report); 4)\\\\r\\\\ndisk and document scanning applications includes a project a) on planning\\\\r\\\\nplatters and disk management, b) on generating an application profile for\\\\r\\\\nEIM when images are stored and distributed on CD-ROM, and c) on\\\\r\\\\nevaluating SCSI2, and how a common command set can be generated for SCSI2\\\\r\\\\nso that document scanners are more easily integrated.  (ANSI/AIIM MS53\\\\r\\\\nwill also apply to compressed images.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nBATTIN * The implications of standards for preservation * A major\\\\r\\\\nobstacle to successful cooperation * A hindrance to access in the digital\\\\r\\\\nenvironment * Standards a double-edged sword for those concerned with the\\\\r\\\\npreservation of the human record * Near-term prognosis for reliable\\\\r\\\\narchival standards * Preservation concerns for electronic media * Need\\\\r\\\\nfor reconceptualizing our preservation principles * Standards in the real\\\\r\\\\nworld and the politics of reproduction * Need to redefine the concept of\\\\r\\\\narchival and to begin to think in terms of life cycles * Cooperation and\\\\r\\\\nthe La Guardia Eight * Concerns generated by discussions on the problems\\\\r\\\\nof preserving text and image * General principles to be adopted in a\\\\r\\\\nworld without standards *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPatricia BATTIN, president, the Commission on Preservation and Access\\\\r\\\\n(CPA), addressed the implications of standards for preservation.  She\\\\r\\\\nlisted several areas where the library profession and the analog world of\\\\r\\\\nthe printed book had made enormous contributions over the past hundred\\\\r\\\\nyears--for example, in bibliographic formats, binding standards, and, most\\\\r\\\\nimportant, in determining what constitutes longevity or archival quality.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlthough standards have lightened the preservation burden through the\\\\r\\\\ndevelopment of national and international collaborative programs,\\\\r\\\\nnevertheless, a pervasive mistrust of other people\\\\\\'s standards remains a\\\\r\\\\nmajor obstacle to successful cooperation, BATTIN said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe zeal to achieve perfection, regardless of the cost, has hindered\\\\r\\\\nrather than facilitated access in some instances, and in the digital\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, where no real standards exist, has brought an ironically\\\\r\\\\njust reward.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBATTIN argued that standards are a double-edged sword for those concerned\\\\r\\\\nwith the preservation of the human record, that is, the provision of\\\\r\\\\naccess to recorded knowledge in a multitude of media as far into the\\\\r\\\\nfuture as possible.  Standards are essential to facilitate\\\\r\\\\ninterconnectivity and access, but, BATTIN said, as LYNCH pointed out\\\\r\\\\nyesterday, if set too soon they can hinder creativity, expansion of\\\\r\\\\ncapability, and the broadening of access.  The characteristics of\\\\r\\\\nstandards for digital imagery differ radically from those for analog\\\\r\\\\nimagery.  And the nature of digital technology implies continuing\\\\r\\\\nvolatility and change.  To reiterate, precipitous standard-setting can\\\\r\\\\ninhibit creativity, but delayed standard-setting results in chaos.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSince in BATTIN\\\\\\'S opinion the near-term prognosis for reliable archival\\\\r\\\\nstandards, as defined by librarians in the analog world, is poor, two\\\\r\\\\nalternatives remain:  standing pat with the old technology, or\\\\r\\\\nreconceptualizing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPreservation concerns for electronic media fall into two general domains.\\\\r\\\\nOne is the continuing assurance of access to knowledge originally\\\\r\\\\ngenerated, stored, disseminated, and used in electronic form.  This\\\\r\\\\ndomain contains several subdivisions, including 1) the closed,\\\\r\\\\nproprietary systems discussed the previous day, bundled information such\\\\r\\\\nas electronic journals and government agency records, and electronically\\\\r\\\\nproduced or captured raw data; and 2) the application of digital\\\\r\\\\ntechnologies to the reformatting of materials originally published on a\\\\r\\\\ndeteriorating analog medium such as acid paper or videotape.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe preservation of electronic media requires a reconceptualizing of our\\\\r\\\\npreservation principles during a volatile, standardless transition which\\\\r\\\\nmay last far longer than any of us envision today.  BATTIN urged the\\\\r\\\\nnecessity of shifting focus from assessing, measuring, and setting\\\\r\\\\nstandards for the permanence of the medium to the concept of managing\\\\r\\\\ncontinuing access to information stored on a variety of media and\\\\r\\\\nrequiring a variety of ever-changing hardware and software for access--a\\\\r\\\\nfundamental shift for the library profession.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBATTIN offered a primer on how to move forward with reasonable confidence\\\\r\\\\nin a world without standards.  Her comments fell roughly into two sections:\\\\r\\\\n1) standards in the real world and 2) the politics of reproduction.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn regard to real-world standards, BATTIN argued the need to redefine the\\\\r\\\\nconcept of archive and to begin to think in terms of life cycles.  In\\\\r\\\\nthe past, the naive assumption that paper would last forever produced a\\\\r\\\\ncavalier attitude toward life cycles.  The transient nature of the\\\\r\\\\nelectronic media has compelled people to recognize and accept upfront the\\\\r\\\\nconcept of life cycles in place of permanency.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDigital standards have to be developed and set in a cooperative context\\\\r\\\\nto ensure efficient exchange of information.  Moreover, during this\\\\r\\\\ntransition period, greater flexibility concerning how concepts such as\\\\r\\\\nbackup copies and archival copies in the CXP are defined is necessary,\\\\r\\\\nor the opportunity to move forward will be lost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn terms of cooperation, particularly in the university setting, BATTIN\\\\r\\\\nalso argued the need to avoid going off in a hundred different\\\\r\\\\ndirections.  The CPA has catalyzed a small group of universities called\\\\r\\\\nthe La Guardia Eight--because La Guardia Airport is where meetings take\\\\r\\\\nplace--Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Princeton, Penn State, Tennessee,\\\\r\\\\nStanford, and USC, to develop a digital preservation consortium to look\\\\r\\\\nat all these issues and develop de facto standards as we move along,\\\\r\\\\ninstead of waiting for something that is officially blessed.  Continuing\\\\r\\\\nto apply analog values and definitions of standards to the digital\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, BATTIN said, will effectively lead to forfeiture of the\\\\r\\\\nbenefits of digital technology to research and scholarship.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUnder the second rubric, the politics of reproduction, BATTIN reiterated\\\\r\\\\nan oft-made argument concerning the electronic library, namely, that it\\\\r\\\\nis more difficult to transform than to create, and nowhere is that belief\\\\r\\\\nexpressed more dramatically than in the conversion of brittle books to\\\\r\\\\nnew media.  Preserving information published in electronic media involves\\\\r\\\\nmaking sure the information remains accessible and that digital\\\\r\\\\ninformation is not lost through reproduction.  In the analog world of\\\\r\\\\nphotocopies and microfilm, the issue of fidelity to the original becomes\\\\r\\\\nparamount, as do issues of \"Whose fidelity?\" and \"Whose original?\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBATTIN elaborated these arguments with a few examples from a recent study\\\\r\\\\nconducted by the CPA on the problems of preserving text and image.\\\\r\\\\nDiscussions with scholars, librarians, and curators in a variety of\\\\r\\\\ndisciplines dependent on text and image generated a variety of concerns,\\\\r\\\\nfor example:  1) Copy what is, not what the technology is capable of.\\\\r\\\\nThis is very important for the history of ideas.  Scholars wish to know\\\\r\\\\nwhat the author saw and worked from.  And make available at the\\\\r\\\\nworkstation the opportunity to erase all the defects and enhance the\\\\r\\\\npresentation.  2) The fidelity of reproduction--what is good enough, what\\\\r\\\\ncan we afford, and the difference it makes--issues of subjective versus\\\\r\\\\nobjective resolution.  3) The differences between primary and secondary\\\\r\\\\nusers.  Restricting the definition of primary user to the one in whose\\\\r\\\\ndiscipline the material has been published runs one headlong into the\\\\r\\\\nreality that these printed books have had a host of other users from a\\\\r\\\\nhost of other disciplines, who not only were looking for very different\\\\r\\\\nthings, but who also shared values very different from those of the\\\\r\\\\nprimary user.  4) The relationship of the standard of reproduction to new\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities of scholarship--the browsing standard versus an archival\\\\r\\\\nstandard.  How good must the archival standard be?  Can a distinction be\\\\r\\\\ndrawn between potential users in setting standards for reproduction?\\\\r\\\\nArchival storage, use copies, browsing copies--ought an attempt to set\\\\r\\\\nstandards even be made?  5) Finally, costs.  How much are we prepared to\\\\r\\\\npay to capture absolute fidelity?  What are the trade-offs between vastly\\\\r\\\\nenhanced access, degrees of fidelity, and costs?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThese standards, BATTIN concluded, serve to complicate further the\\\\r\\\\nreproduction process, and add to the long list of technical standards\\\\r\\\\nthat are necessary to ensure widespread access.  Ways to articulate and\\\\r\\\\nanalyze the costs that are attached to the different levels of standards\\\\r\\\\nmust be found.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiven the chaos concerning standards, which promises to linger for the\\\\r\\\\nforeseeable future, BATTIN urged adoption of the following general\\\\r\\\\nprinciples:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Strive to understand the changing information requirements of\\\\r\\\\n     scholarly disciplines as more and more technology is integrated into\\\\r\\\\n     the process of research and scholarly communication in order to meet\\\\r\\\\n     future scholarly needs, not to build for the past.  Capture\\\\r\\\\n     deteriorating information at the highest affordable resolution, even\\\\r\\\\n     though the dissemination and display technologies will lag.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Develop cooperative mechanisms to foster agreement on protocols\\\\r\\\\n     for document structure and other interchange mechanisms necessary\\\\r\\\\n     for widespread dissemination and use before official standards are\\\\r\\\\n     set.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Accept that, in a transition period, de facto standards will have\\\\r\\\\n     to be developed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Capture information in a way that keeps all options open and\\\\r\\\\n     provides for total convertibility:  OCR, scanning of microfilm,\\\\r\\\\n     producing microfilm from scanned documents, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Work closely with the generators of information and the builders\\\\r\\\\n     of networks and databases to ensure that continuing accessibility is\\\\r\\\\n     a primary concern from the beginning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Piggyback on standards under development for the broad market, and\\\\r\\\\n     avoid library-specific standards; work with the vendors, in order to\\\\r\\\\n     take advantage of that which is being standardized for the rest of\\\\r\\\\n     the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Concentrate efforts on managing permanence in the digital world,\\\\r\\\\n     rather than perfecting the longevity of a particular medium.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Additional comments on TIFF *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the brief discussion period that followed BATTIN\\\\\\'s presentation,\\\\r\\\\nBARONAS explained that TIFF was not developed in collaboration with or\\\\r\\\\nunder the auspices of AIIM.  TIFF is a company product, not a standard,\\\\r\\\\nis owned by two corporations, and is always changing.  BARONAS also\\\\r\\\\nobserved that ANSI/AIIM MS53, a bi-level image file transfer format that\\\\r\\\\nallows unlike systems to exchange images, is compatible with TIFF as well\\\\r\\\\nas with DEC\\\\\\'s architecture and IBM\\\\\\'s MODCA/IOCA.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nHOOTON * Several questions to be considered in discussing text conversion\\\\r\\\\n*\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOOTON introduced the final topic, text conversion, by noting that it is\\\\r\\\\nbecoming an increasingly important part of the imaging business.  Many\\\\r\\\\npeople now realize that it enhances their system to be able to have more\\\\r\\\\nand more character data as part of their imaging system.  Re the issue of\\\\r\\\\nOCR versus rekeying, HOOTON posed several questions:  How does one get\\\\r\\\\ntext into computer-readable form?  Does one use automated processes?\\\\r\\\\nDoes one attempt to eliminate the use of operators where possible?\\\\r\\\\nStandards for accuracy, he said, are extremely important:  it makes a\\\\r\\\\nmajor difference in cost and time whether one sets as a standard 98.5\\\\r\\\\npercent acceptance or 99.5 percent.  He mentioned outsourcing as a\\\\r\\\\npossibility for converting text.  Finally, what one does with the image\\\\r\\\\nto prepare it for the recognition process is also important, he said,\\\\r\\\\nbecause such preparation changes how recognition is viewed, as well as\\\\r\\\\nfacilitates recognition itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nLESK * Roles of participants in CORE * Data flow * The scanning process *\\\\r\\\\nThe image interface * Results of experiments involving the use of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic resources and traditional paper copies * Testing the issue of\\\\r\\\\nserendipity * Conclusions *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMichael LESK, executive director, Computer Science Research, Bell\\\\r\\\\nCommunications Research, Inc. (Bellcore), discussed the Chemical Online\\\\r\\\\nRetrieval Experiment (CORE), a cooperative project involving Cornell\\\\r\\\\nUniversity, OCLC, Bellcore, and the American Chemical Society (ACS).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK spoke on 1) how the scanning was performed, including the unusual\\\\r\\\\nfeature of page segmentation, and 2) the use made of the text and the\\\\r\\\\nimage in experiments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWorking with the chemistry journals (because ACS has been saving its\\\\r\\\\ntypesetting tapes since the mid-1970s and thus has a significant back-run\\\\r\\\\nof the most important chemistry journals in the United States), CORE is\\\\r\\\\nattempting to create an automated chemical library.  Approximately a\\\\r\\\\nquarter of the pages by square inch are made up of images of\\\\r\\\\nquasi-pictorial material; dealing with the graphic components of the\\\\r\\\\npages is extremely important.  LESK described the roles of participants\\\\r\\\\nin CORE:  1) ACS provides copyright permission, journals on paper,\\\\r\\\\njournals on microfilm, and some of the definitions of the files; 2) at\\\\r\\\\nBellcore, LESK chiefly performs the data preparation, while Dennis Egan\\\\r\\\\nperforms experiments on the users of chemical abstracts, and supplies the\\\\r\\\\nindexing and numerous magnetic tapes;  3) Cornell provides the site of the\\\\r\\\\nexperiment; 4) OCLC develops retrieval software and other user interfaces.\\\\r\\\\nVarious manufacturers and publishers have furnished other help.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning data flow, Bellcore receives microfilm and paper from ACS; the\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm is scanned by outside vendors, while the paper is scanned\\\\r\\\\ninhouse on an Improvision scanner, twenty pages per minute at 300 dpi,\\\\r\\\\nwhich provides sufficient quality for all practical uses.  LESK would\\\\r\\\\nprefer to have more gray level, because one of the ACS journals prints on\\\\r\\\\nsome colored pages, which creates a problem.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBellcore performs all this scanning, creates a page-image file, and also\\\\r\\\\nselects from the pages the graphics, to mix with the text file (which is\\\\r\\\\ndiscussed later in the Workshop).  The user is always searching the ASCII\\\\r\\\\nfile, but she or he may see a display based on the ASCII or a display\\\\r\\\\nbased on the images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK illustrated how the program performs page analysis, and the image\\\\r\\\\ninterface.  (The user types several words, is presented with a list--\\\\r\\\\nusually of the titles of articles contained in an issue--that derives\\\\r\\\\nfrom the ASCII, clicks on an icon and receives an image that mirrors an\\\\r\\\\nACS page.)  LESK also illustrated an alternative interface, based on text\\\\r\\\\non the ASCII, the so-called SuperBook interface from Bellcore.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK next presented the results of an experiment conducted by Dennis Egan\\\\r\\\\nand involving thirty-six students at Cornell, one third of them\\\\r\\\\nundergraduate chemistry majors, one third senior undergraduate chemistry\\\\r\\\\nmajors, and one third graduate chemistry students.  A third of them\\\\r\\\\nreceived the paper journals, the traditional paper copies and chemical\\\\r\\\\nabstracts on paper.  A third received image displays of the pictures of\\\\r\\\\nthe pages, and a third received the text display with pop-up graphics.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe students were given several questions made up by some chemistry\\\\r\\\\nprofessors.  The questions fell into five classes, ranging from very easy\\\\r\\\\nto very difficult, and included questions designed to simulate browsing\\\\r\\\\nas well as a traditional information retrieval-type task.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK furnished the following results.  In the straightforward question\\\\r\\\\nsearch--the question being, what is the phosphorus oxygen bond distance\\\\r\\\\nand hydroxy phosphate?--the students were told that they could take\\\\r\\\\nfifteen minutes and, then, if they wished, give up.  The students with\\\\r\\\\npaper took more than fifteen minutes on average, and yet most of them\\\\r\\\\ngave up.  The students with either electronic format, text or image,\\\\r\\\\nreceived good scores in reasonable time, hardly ever had to give up, and\\\\r\\\\nusually found the right answer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the browsing study, the students were given a list of eight topics,\\\\r\\\\ntold to imagine that an issue of the Journal of the American Chemical\\\\r\\\\nSociety had just appeared on their desks, and were also told to flip\\\\r\\\\nthrough it and to find topics mentioned in the issue.  The average scores\\\\r\\\\nwere about the same.  (The students were told to answer yes or no about\\\\r\\\\nwhether or not particular topics appeared.)  The errors, however, were\\\\r\\\\nquite different.  The students with paper rarely said that something\\\\r\\\\nappeared when it had not.  But they often failed to find something\\\\r\\\\nactually mentioned in the issue.  The computer people found numerous\\\\r\\\\nthings, but they also frequently said that a topic was mentioned when it\\\\r\\\\nwas not.  (The reason, of course, was that they were performing word\\\\r\\\\nsearches.  They were finding that words were mentioned and they were\\\\r\\\\nconcluding that they had accomplished their task.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis question also contained a trick to test the issue of serendipity.\\\\r\\\\nThe students were given another list of eight topics and instructed,\\\\r\\\\nwithout taking a second look at the journal, to recall how many of this\\\\r\\\\nnew list of eight topics were in this particular issue.  This was an\\\\r\\\\nattempt to see if they performed better at remembering what they were not\\\\r\\\\nlooking for.  They all performed about the same, paper or electronics,\\\\r\\\\nabout 62 percent accurate.  In short, LESK said, people were not very\\\\r\\\\ngood when it came to serendipity, but they were no worse at it with\\\\r\\\\ncomputers than they were with paper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n(LESK gave a parenthetical illustration of the learning curve of students\\\\r\\\\nwho used SuperBook.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe students using the electronic systems started off worse than the ones\\\\r\\\\nusing print, but by the third of the three sessions in the series had\\\\r\\\\ncaught up to print.  As one might expect, electronics provide a much\\\\r\\\\nbetter means of finding what one wants to read; reading speeds, once the\\\\r\\\\nobject of the search has been found, are about the same.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlmost none of the students could perform the hard task--the analogous\\\\r\\\\ntransformation.  (It would require the expertise of organic chemists to\\\\r\\\\ncomplete.)  But an interesting result was that the students using the text\\\\r\\\\nsearch performed terribly, while those using the image system did best.\\\\r\\\\nThat the text search system is driven by text offers the explanation.\\\\r\\\\nEverything is focused on the text; to see the pictures, one must press\\\\r\\\\non an icon.  Many students found the right article containing the answer\\\\r\\\\nto the question, but they did not click on the icon to bring up the right\\\\r\\\\nfigure and see it.  They did not know that they had found the right place,\\\\r\\\\nand thus got it wrong.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe short answer demonstrated by this experiment was that in the event\\\\r\\\\none does not know what to read, one needs the electronic systems; the\\\\r\\\\nelectronic systems hold no advantage at the moment if one knows what to\\\\r\\\\nread, but neither do they impose a penalty.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK concluded by commenting that, on one hand, the image system was easy\\\\r\\\\nto use.  On the other hand, the text display system, which represented\\\\r\\\\ntwenty man-years of work in programming and polishing, was not winning,\\\\r\\\\nbecause the text was not being read, just searched.  The much easier\\\\r\\\\nsystem is highly competitive as well as remarkably effective for the\\\\r\\\\nactual chemists.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nERWAY * Most challenging aspect of working on AM * Assumptions guiding\\\\r\\\\nAM\\\\\\'s approach * Testing different types of service bureaus * AM\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nrequirement for 99.95 percent accuracy * Requirements for text-coding *\\\\r\\\\nAdditional factors influencing AM\\\\\\'s approach to coding * Results of AM\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nexperience with rekeying * Other problems in dealing with service bureaus\\\\r\\\\n* Quality control the most time-consuming aspect of contracting out\\\\r\\\\nconversion * Long-term outlook uncertain *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Ricky ERWAY, associate coordinator, American Memory, Library of\\\\r\\\\nCongress, the constant variety of conversion projects taking place\\\\r\\\\nsimultaneously represented perhaps the most challenging aspect of working\\\\r\\\\non AM.  Thus, the challenge was not to find a solution for text\\\\r\\\\nconversion but a tool kit of solutions to apply to LC\\\\\\'s varied\\\\r\\\\ncollections that need to be converted.  ERWAY limited her remarks to the\\\\r\\\\nprocess of converting text to machine-readable form, and the variety of\\\\r\\\\nLC\\\\\\'s text collections, for example, bound volumes, microfilm, and\\\\r\\\\nhandwritten manuscripts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTwo assumptions have guided AM\\\\\\'s approach, ERWAY said:  1) A desire not\\\\r\\\\nto perform the conversion inhouse.  Because of the variety of formats and\\\\r\\\\ntypes of texts, to capitalize the equipment and have the talents and\\\\r\\\\nskills to operate them at LC would be extremely expensive.  Further, the\\\\r\\\\nnatural inclination to upgrade to newer and better equipment each year\\\\r\\\\nmade it reasonable for AM to focus on what it did best and seek external\\\\r\\\\nconversion services.  Using service bureaus also allowed AM to have\\\\r\\\\nseveral types of operations take place at the same time.  2) AM was not a\\\\r\\\\ntechnology project, but an effort to improve access to library\\\\r\\\\ncollections.  Hence, whether text was converted using OCR or rekeying\\\\r\\\\nmattered little to AM.  What mattered were cost and accuracy of results.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAM considered different types of service bureaus and selected three to\\\\r\\\\nperform several small tests in order to acquire a sense of the field.\\\\r\\\\nThe sample collections with which they worked included handwritten\\\\r\\\\ncorrespondence, typewritten manuscripts from the 1940s, and\\\\r\\\\neighteenth-century printed broadsides on microfilm.  On none of these\\\\r\\\\nsamples was OCR performed; they were all rekeyed.  AM had several special\\\\r\\\\nrequirements for the three service bureaus it had engaged.  For instance,\\\\r\\\\nany errors in the original text were to be retained.  Working from bound\\\\r\\\\nvolumes or anything that could not be sheet-fed also constituted a factor\\\\r\\\\neliminating companies that would have performed OCR.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAM requires 99.95 percent accuracy, which, though it sounds high, often\\\\r\\\\nmeans one or two errors per page.  The initial batch of test samples\\\\r\\\\ncontained several handwritten materials for which AM did not require\\\\r\\\\ntext-coding.  The results, ERWAY reported, were in all cases fairly\\\\r\\\\ncomparable:  for the most part, all three service bureaus achieved 99.95\\\\r\\\\npercent accuracy.  AM was satisfied with the work but surprised at the cost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs AM began converting whole collections, it retained the requirement for\\\\r\\\\n99.95 percent accuracy and added requirements for text-coding.  AM needed\\\\r\\\\nto begin performing work more than three years ago before LC requirements\\\\r\\\\nfor SGML applications had been established.  Since AM\\\\\\'s goal was simply\\\\r\\\\nto retain any of the intellectual content represented by the formatting\\\\r\\\\nof the document (which would be lost if one performed a straight ASCII\\\\r\\\\nconversion), AM used \"SGML-like\" codes.  These codes resembled SGML tags\\\\r\\\\nbut were used without the benefit of document-type definitions.  AM found\\\\r\\\\nthat many service bureaus were not yet SGML-proficient.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdditional factors influencing the approach AM took with respect to\\\\r\\\\ncoding included:  1) the inability of any known microcomputer-based\\\\r\\\\nuser-retrieval software to take advantage of SGML coding; and 2) the\\\\r\\\\nmultiple inconsistencies in format of the older documents, which\\\\r\\\\nconfirmed AM in its desire not to attempt to force the different formats\\\\r\\\\nto conform to a single document-type definition (DTD) and thus create the\\\\r\\\\nneed for a separate DTD for each document.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe five text collections that AM has converted or is in the process of\\\\r\\\\nconverting include a collection of eighteenth-century broadsides, a\\\\r\\\\ncollection of pamphlets, two typescript document collections, and a\\\\r\\\\ncollection of 150 books.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nERWAY next reviewed the results of AM\\\\\\'s experience with rekeying, noting\\\\r\\\\nagain that because the bulk of AM\\\\\\'s materials are historical, the quality\\\\r\\\\nof the text often does not lend itself to OCR.  While non-English\\\\r\\\\nspeakers are less likely to guess or elaborate or correct typos in the\\\\r\\\\noriginal text, they are also less able to infer what we would; they also\\\\r\\\\nare nearly incapable of converting handwritten text.  Another\\\\r\\\\ndisadvantage of working with overseas keyers is that they are much less\\\\r\\\\nlikely to telephone with questions, especially on the coding, with the\\\\r\\\\nresult that they develop their own rules as they encounter new\\\\r\\\\nsituations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGovernment contracting procedures and time frames posed a major challenge\\\\r\\\\nto performing the conversion.  Many service bureaus are not accustomed to\\\\r\\\\nretaining the image, even if they perform OCR.  Thus, questions of image\\\\r\\\\nformat and storage media were somewhat novel to many of them.  ERWAY also\\\\r\\\\nremarked other problems in dealing with service bureaus, for example,\\\\r\\\\ntheir inability to perform text conversion from the kind of microfilm\\\\r\\\\nthat LC uses for preservation purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut quality control, in ERWAY\\\\\\'s experience, was the most time-consuming\\\\r\\\\naspect of contracting out conversion.  AM has been attempting to perform\\\\r\\\\na 10-percent quality review, looking at either every tenth document or\\\\r\\\\nevery tenth page to make certain that the service bureaus are maintaining\\\\r\\\\n99.95 percent accuracy.  But even if they are complying with the\\\\r\\\\nrequirement for accuracy, finding errors produces a desire to correct\\\\r\\\\nthem and, in turn, to clean up the whole collection, which defeats the\\\\r\\\\npurpose to some extent.  Even a double entry requires a\\\\r\\\\ncharacter-by-character comparison to the original to meet the accuracy\\\\r\\\\nrequirement.  LC is not accustomed to publish imperfect texts, which\\\\r\\\\nmakes attempting to deal with the industry standard an emotionally\\\\r\\\\nfraught issue for AM.  As was mentioned in the previous day\\\\\\'s discussion,\\\\r\\\\ngoing from 99.95 to 99.99 percent accuracy usually doubles costs and\\\\r\\\\nmeans a third keying or another complete run-through of the text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlthough AM has learned much from its experiences with various collections\\\\r\\\\nand various service bureaus, ERWAY concluded pessimistically that no\\\\r\\\\nbreakthrough has been achieved.   Incremental improvements have occurred\\\\r\\\\nin some of the OCR technology, some of the processes, and some of the\\\\r\\\\nstandards acceptances, which, though they may lead to somewhat lower costs,\\\\r\\\\ndo not offer much encouragement to many people who are anxiously awaiting\\\\r\\\\nthe day that the entire contents of LC are available on-line.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR * Several answers to why one attempts to perform full-text\\\\r\\\\nconversion * Per page cost of performing OCR * Typical problems\\\\r\\\\nencountered during editing * Editing poor copy OCR vs. rekeying *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJudith ZIDAR, coordinator, National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program\\\\r\\\\n(NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL), offered several answers to\\\\r\\\\nthe question of why one attempts to perform full-text conversion:  1)\\\\r\\\\nText in an image can be read by a human but not by a computer, so of\\\\r\\\\ncourse it is not searchable and there is not much one can do with it.  2)\\\\r\\\\nSome material simply requires word-level access.  For instance, the legal\\\\r\\\\nprofession insists on full-text access to its material; with taxonomic or\\\\r\\\\ngeographic material, which entails numerous names, one virtually requires\\\\r\\\\nword-level access.  3) Full text permits rapid browsing and searching,\\\\r\\\\nsomething that cannot be achieved in an image with today\\\\\\'s technology.\\\\r\\\\n4) Text stored as ASCII and delivered in ASCII is standardized and highly\\\\r\\\\nportable.  5) People just want full-text searching, even those who do not\\\\r\\\\nknow how to do it.  NAL, for the most part, is performing OCR at an\\\\r\\\\nactual cost per average-size page of approximately $7.  NAL scans the\\\\r\\\\npage to create the electronic image and passes it through the OCR device.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR next rehearsed several typical problems encountered during editing.\\\\r\\\\nPraising the celerity of her student workers, ZIDAR observed that editing\\\\r\\\\nrequires approximately five to ten minutes per page, assuming that there\\\\r\\\\nare no large tables to audit.  Confusion among the three characters I, 1,\\\\r\\\\nand l, constitutes perhaps the most common problem encountered.  Zeroes\\\\r\\\\nand  O\\\\\\'s also are  frequently confused.  Double M\\\\\\'s create a particular\\\\r\\\\nproblem, even on clean pages.  They are so wide in most fonts that they\\\\r\\\\ntouch, and the system simply cannot tell where one letter ends and the\\\\r\\\\nother begins.  Complex page formats occasionally fail to columnate\\\\r\\\\nproperly, which entails rescanning as though one were working with a\\\\r\\\\nsingle column, entering the ASCII, and decolumnating for better\\\\r\\\\nsearching.  With proportionally spaced text, OCR can have difficulty\\\\r\\\\ndiscerning what is a space and what are merely spaces between letters, as\\\\r\\\\nopposed to spaces between words, and therefore will merge text or break\\\\r\\\\nup words where it should not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR said that it can often take longer to edit a poor-copy OCR than to\\\\r\\\\nkey it from scratch.  NAL has also experimented with partial editing of\\\\r\\\\ntext, whereby project workers go into and clean up the format, removing\\\\r\\\\nstray characters but not running a spell-check.  NAL corrects typos in\\\\r\\\\nthe title and authors\\\\\\' names, which provides a foothold for searching and\\\\r\\\\nbrowsing.  Even extremely poor-quality OCR (e.g., 60-percent accuracy)\\\\r\\\\ncan still be searched, because numerous words are correct, while the\\\\r\\\\nimportant words are probably repeated often enough that they are likely\\\\r\\\\nto be found correct somewhere.  Librarians, however, cannot tolerate this\\\\r\\\\nsituation, though end users seem more willing to use this text for\\\\r\\\\nsearching, provided that NAL indicates that it is unedited.  ZIDAR\\\\r\\\\nconcluded that rekeying of text may be the best route to take, in spite\\\\r\\\\nof numerous problems with quality control and cost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Modifying an image before performing OCR * NAL\\\\\\'s costs per\\\\r\\\\npage *AM\\\\\\'s costs per page and experience with Federal Prison Industries *\\\\r\\\\nElements comprising NATDP\\\\\\'s costs per page * OCR and structured markup *\\\\r\\\\nDistinction between the structure of a document and its representation\\\\r\\\\nwhen put on the screen or printed *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several\\\\r\\\\ncomments about modifying an image before one reaches the point of\\\\r\\\\nperforming OCR.  For example, in regard to an application containing a\\\\r\\\\nsignificant amount of redundant data, such as form-type data, numerous\\\\r\\\\ncompanies today are working on various kinds of form renewal, prior to\\\\r\\\\ngoing through a recognition process, by using dropout colors.  Thus,\\\\r\\\\nacquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth\\\\r\\\\nconsidering.  HOOTON also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks\\\\r\\\\none\\\\\\'s imaging system.  It is extremely important, extremely costly in\\\\r\\\\nterms of either capital investment or service, and determines the quality\\\\r\\\\nof the remainder of one\\\\\\'s system, because it determines the character of\\\\r\\\\nthe raw material used by the system.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning the four projects undertaken by NAL, two inside and two\\\\r\\\\nperformed by outside contractors, ZIDAR revealed that an in-house service\\\\r\\\\nbureau executed the first at a cost between $8 and $10 per page for\\\\r\\\\neverything, including building of the database.  The project undertaken\\\\r\\\\nby the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)\\\\r\\\\ncost approximately $10 per page for the conversion, plus some expenses\\\\r\\\\nfor the software and building of the database.  The Acid Rain Project--a\\\\r\\\\ntwo-disk set produced by the University of Vermont, consisting of\\\\r\\\\nCanadian publications on acid rain--cost $6.70 per page for everything,\\\\r\\\\nincluding keying of the text, which was double keyed, scanning of the\\\\r\\\\nimages, and building of the database.  The in-house project offered\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable ease of convenience and greater control of the process.  On\\\\r\\\\nthe other hand, the service bureaus know their job and perform it\\\\r\\\\nexpeditiously, because they have more people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs a useful comparison, ERWAY revealed AM\\\\\\'s costs as follows:  $0.75\\\\r\\\\ncents to $0.85 cents per thousand characters, with an average page\\\\r\\\\ncontaining 2,700 characters.  Requirements for coding and imaging\\\\r\\\\nincrease the costs.  Thus, conversion of the text, including the coding,\\\\r\\\\ncosts approximately $3 per page.  (This figure does not include the\\\\r\\\\nimaging and database-building included in the NAL costs.)  AM also\\\\r\\\\nenjoyed a happy experience with Federal Prison Industries, which\\\\r\\\\nprecluded the necessity of going through the request-for-proposal process\\\\r\\\\nto award a contract, because it is another government agency.  The\\\\r\\\\nprisoners performed AM\\\\\\'s rekeying just as well as other service bureaus\\\\r\\\\nand proved handy as well.  AM shipped them the books, which they would\\\\r\\\\nphotocopy on a book-edge scanner.  They would perform the markup on\\\\r\\\\nphotocopies, return the books as soon as they were done with them,\\\\r\\\\nperform the keying, and return the material to AM on WORM disks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nZIDAR detailed the elements that constitute the previously noted cost of\\\\r\\\\napproximately $7 per page.  Most significant is the editing, correction\\\\r\\\\nof errors, and spell-checkings, which though they may sound easy to\\\\r\\\\nperform require, in fact, a great deal of time.  Reformatting text also\\\\r\\\\ntakes a while, but a significant amount of NAL\\\\\\'s expenses are for equipment,\\\\r\\\\nwhich was extremely expensive when purchased because it was one of the few\\\\r\\\\nsystems on the market.  The costs of equipment are being amortized over\\\\r\\\\nfive years but are still quite high, nearly $2,000 per month.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the amount of editing\\\\r\\\\nrequired (substantial in her experience) to generate the kind of\\\\r\\\\nstructured markup necessary for manipulating the text on the computer or\\\\r\\\\nloading it into any retrieval system.  She wondered if the speakers could\\\\r\\\\nextend the previous question about the cost-benefit of adding or exerting\\\\r\\\\nstructured markup.  ERWAY noted that several OCR systems retain italics,\\\\r\\\\nbolding, and other spatial formatting.  While the material may not be in\\\\r\\\\nthe format desired, these systems possess the ability to remove the\\\\r\\\\noriginal materials quickly from the hands of the people performing the\\\\r\\\\nconversion, as well as to retain that information so that users can work\\\\r\\\\nwith it.  HOCKEY rejoined that the current thinking on markup is that one\\\\r\\\\nshould not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that\\\\r\\\\nway.  To be sure, one needs to know that something was italicized, but\\\\r\\\\nhow can one get from one to the other?  One can map from the structure to\\\\r\\\\nthe typographic representation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER suggested that, given the 100 million items the Library\\\\r\\\\nholds, it may not be possible for LC to do more than report that a thing\\\\r\\\\nwas in italics as opposed to why it was italics, although that may be\\\\r\\\\ndesirable in some contexts.  Promising to talk a bit during the afternoon\\\\r\\\\nsession about several experiments OCLC performed on automatic recognition\\\\r\\\\nof document elements, and which they hoped to extend, WEIBEL said that in\\\\r\\\\nfact one can recognize the major elements of a document with a fairly\\\\r\\\\nhigh degree of reliability, at least as good as OCR.  STEVENS drew a\\\\r\\\\nuseful distinction between standard, generalized markup (i.e., defining\\\\r\\\\nfor a document-type definition the structure of the document), and what\\\\r\\\\nhe termed a style sheet, which had to do with italics, bolding, and other\\\\r\\\\nforms of emphasis.  Thus, two different components are at work, one being\\\\r\\\\nthe structure of the document itself (its logic), and the other being its\\\\r\\\\nrepresentation when it is put on the screen or printed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION V.  APPROACHES TO PREPARING ELECTRONIC TEXTS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY * Text in ASCII and the representation of electronic text versus\\\\r\\\\nan image * The need to look at ways of using markup to assist retrieval *\\\\r\\\\nThe need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSusan HOCKEY, director, Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities\\\\r\\\\n(CETH), Rutgers and Princeton Universities, announced that one talk\\\\r\\\\n(WEIBEL\\\\\\'s) was moved into this session from the morning and that David\\\\r\\\\nPackard was unable to attend.  The session would attempt to focus more on\\\\r\\\\nwhat one can do with a text in ASCII and the representation of electronic\\\\r\\\\ntext rather than just an image, what one can do with a computer that\\\\r\\\\ncannot be done with a book or an image.  It would be argued that one can\\\\r\\\\ndo much more than just read a text, and from that starting point one can\\\\r\\\\nuse markup and methods of preparing the text to take full advantage of\\\\r\\\\nthe capability of the computer.  That would lead to a discussion of what\\\\r\\\\nthe European Community calls REUSABILITY, what may better be termed\\\\r\\\\nDURABILITY, that is, how to prepare or make a text that will last a long\\\\r\\\\ntime and that can be used for as many applications as possible, which\\\\r\\\\nwould lead to issues of improving intellectual access.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY urged the need to look at ways of using markup to facilitate retrieval,\\\\r\\\\nnot just for referencing or to help locate an item that is retrieved, but also to put markup tags in\\\\r\\\\na text to help retrieve the thing sought either with linguistic tagging or\\\\r\\\\ninterpretation.  HOCKEY also argued that little advancement had occurred in\\\\r\\\\nthe software tools currently available for retrieving and searching text.\\\\r\\\\nShe pressed the desideratum of going beyond Boolean searches and performing\\\\r\\\\nmore sophisticated searching, which the insertion of more markup in the text\\\\r\\\\nwould facilitate.  Thinking about electronic texts as opposed to images means\\\\r\\\\nconsidering material that will never appear in print form, or print will not\\\\r\\\\nbe its primary form, that is, material which only appears in electronic form.\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY alluded to the history and the need for markup and tagging and\\\\r\\\\nelectronic text, which was developed through the use of computers in the\\\\r\\\\nhumanities; as MICHELSON had observed, Father Busa had started in 1949\\\\r\\\\nto prepare the first-ever text on the computer.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY remarked several large projects, particularly in Europe, for the\\\\r\\\\ncompilation of dictionaries, language studies, and language analysis, in\\\\r\\\\nwhich people have built up archives of text and have begun to recognize\\\\r\\\\nthe need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional,\\\\r\\\\nthat can be used not just to print the text, which may be assumed to be a\\\\r\\\\nbyproduct of what one wants to do, but to structure it inside the computer\\\\r\\\\nso that it can be searched, built into a Hypertext system, etc.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL * OCLC\\\\\\'s approach to preparing electronic text:  retroconversion,\\\\r\\\\nkeying of texts, more automated ways of developing data * Project ADAPT\\\\r\\\\nand the CORE Project * Intelligent character recognition does not exist *\\\\r\\\\nAdvantages of SGML * Data should be free of procedural markup;\\\\r\\\\ndescriptive markup strongly advocated * OCLC\\\\\\'s interface illustrated *\\\\r\\\\nStorage requirements and costs for putting a lot of information on line *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStuart WEIBEL, senior research scientist, Online Computer Library Center,\\\\r\\\\nInc. (OCLC), described OCLC\\\\\\'s approach to preparing electronic text.  He\\\\r\\\\nargued that the electronic world into which we are moving must\\\\r\\\\naccommodate not only the future but the past as well, and to some degree\\\\r\\\\neven the present.  Thus, starting out at one end with retroconversion and\\\\r\\\\nkeying of texts, one would like to move toward much more automated ways\\\\r\\\\nof developing data.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor example, Project ADAPT had to do with automatically converting\\\\r\\\\ndocument images into a structured document database with OCR text as\\\\r\\\\nindexing and also a little bit of automatic formatting and tagging of\\\\r\\\\nthat text.  The CORE project hosted by Cornell University, Bellcore,\\\\r\\\\nOCLC, the American Chemical Society, and Chemical Abstracts, constitutes\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL\\\\\\'s principal concern at the moment.  This project is an example of\\\\r\\\\nconverting text for which one already has a machine-readable version into\\\\r\\\\na format more suitable for electronic delivery and database searching.\\\\r\\\\n(Since Michael LESK had previously described CORE, WEIBEL would say\\\\r\\\\nlittle concerning it.)  Borrowing a chemical phrase, de novo synthesis,\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL cited the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials as an example\\\\r\\\\nof de novo electronic publishing, that is, a form in which the primary\\\\r\\\\nform of the information is electronic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject ADAPT, then, which OCLC completed a couple of years ago and in\\\\r\\\\nfact is about to resume, is a model in which one takes page images either\\\\r\\\\nin paper or microfilm and converts them automatically to a searchable\\\\r\\\\nelectronic database, either on-line or local.  The operating assumption\\\\r\\\\nis that accepting some blemishes in the data, especially for\\\\r\\\\nretroconversion of materials, will make it possible to accomplish more.\\\\r\\\\nNot enough money is available to support perfect conversion.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL related several steps taken to perform image preprocessing\\\\r\\\\n(processing on the image before performing optical character\\\\r\\\\nrecognition), as well as image postprocessing.  He denied the existence\\\\r\\\\nof intelligent character recognition and asserted that what is wanted is\\\\r\\\\npage recognition, which is a long way off.  OCLC has experimented with\\\\r\\\\nmerging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will\\\\r\\\\nreduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 5 characters out of every\\\\r\\\\nl,000 to an unacceptable rate of 2 characters out of every l,000, but it\\\\r\\\\nis not good enough.  It will never be perfect.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning the CORE Project, WEIBEL observed that Bellcore is taking the\\\\r\\\\ntopography files, extracting the page images, and converting those\\\\r\\\\ntopography files to SGML markup.  LESK hands that data off to OCLC, which\\\\r\\\\nbuilds that data into a Newton database, the same system that underlies\\\\r\\\\nthe on-line system in virtually all of the reference products at OCLC.\\\\r\\\\nThe long-term goal is to make the systems interoperable so that not just\\\\r\\\\nBellcore\\\\\\'s system and OCLC\\\\\\'s system can access this data, but other\\\\r\\\\nsystems can as well, and the key to that is the Z39.50 common command\\\\r\\\\nlanguage and the full-text extension.  Z39.50 is fine for MARC records,\\\\r\\\\nbut is not enough to do it for full text (that is, make full texts\\\\r\\\\ninteroperable).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes,\\\\r\\\\nfor example, as noted by HOCKEY, in the world of extremely large\\\\r\\\\ndatabases, using highly structured data to perform field searches.\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL argued that by building the structure of the data in (i.e., the\\\\r\\\\nstructure of the data originally on a printed page), it becomes easy to\\\\r\\\\nlook at a journal article even if one cannot read the characters and know\\\\r\\\\nwhere the title or author is, or what the sections of that document would be.\\\\r\\\\nOCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database, because it will\\\\r\\\\nbe important for retrieval purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to\\\\r\\\\nbuild structure into the database that can be used for display purposes\\\\r\\\\nwithout contaminating the data with instructions about how to format\\\\r\\\\nthings.  The distinction lies between procedural markup, which tells one\\\\r\\\\nwhere to put dots on the page, and descriptive markup, which describes\\\\r\\\\nthe elements of a document.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at\\\\r\\\\nall, that the data should be completely unsullied by information about\\\\r\\\\nitalics or boldness.  That should be left up to the display device,\\\\r\\\\nwhether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device.\\\\r\\\\nBy keeping one\\\\\\'s database free of that kind of contamination, one can\\\\r\\\\nmake decisions down the road, for example, reorganize the data in ways\\\\r\\\\nthat are not cramped by built-in notions of what should be italic and\\\\r\\\\nwhat should be bold.  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup.  As\\\\r\\\\nan example, he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data.  With\\\\r\\\\nsubsequent illustrated examples of markup, WEIBEL acknowledged the common\\\\r\\\\ncomplaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form, although markup\\\\r\\\\ndecreases considerably once one gets into the body.  Without the markup,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, one would not have the structure in the data.  One can pass\\\\r\\\\nmarkup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a\\\\r\\\\nprinted version of the document.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLC\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nsystem, in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on\\\\r\\\\nthe screen.  (He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of\\\\r\\\\nX-Windows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project.)  WEIBEL also\\\\r\\\\nillustrated the two major parts of the interface:  l) a control box that\\\\r\\\\nallows one to generate lists of items, which resembles a small table of\\\\r\\\\ncontents based on key words one wishes to search, and 2) a document\\\\r\\\\nviewer, which is a separate process in and of itself.  He demonstrated\\\\r\\\\nhow to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting\\\\r\\\\nthe appropriate button and bringing them up.  He also noted problems that\\\\r\\\\nremain to be accommodated in the interface (e.g., as pointed out by LESK,\\\\r\\\\nwhat happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiven the constraints of time, WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary\\\\r\\\\nitems in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and\\\\r\\\\nwhat will be required to put a lot of things on line.  Since it is\\\\r\\\\nextremely expensive to reconvert all of this data, especially if it is\\\\r\\\\njust in paper form (and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting\\\\r\\\\ntapes), he advocated building journals electronically from the start.  In\\\\r\\\\nthat case, if one only has text graphics and indexing (which is all that\\\\r\\\\none needs with de novo electronic publishing, because there is no need to\\\\r\\\\ngo back and look at bit-maps of pages), one can get 10,000 journals of\\\\r\\\\nfull text, or almost 6 million pages per year.  These pages can be put in\\\\r\\\\napproximately 135 gigabytes of storage, which is not all that much,\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL said.  For twenty years, something less than three terabytes would\\\\r\\\\nbe required.  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as\\\\r\\\\nfollows:  If a gigabyte costs approximately $1,000, then a terabyte costs\\\\r\\\\napproximately $1 million to buy in terms of hardware.  One also needs a\\\\r\\\\nbuilding to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information.\\\\r\\\\nSo, to support a terabyte, multiply by five, which gives $5 million per\\\\r\\\\nyear for a supported terabyte of data.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally\\\\r\\\\nsupporting publication of the journal * Cost of building tagged text into\\\\r\\\\nthe database *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the question-and-answer period that followed WEIBEL\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\npresentation, these clarifications emerged.  The tapes saved by the\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Chemical Society are the typography files that originally\\\\r\\\\nsupported the publication of the journal.  Although they are not tagged\\\\r\\\\nin SGML, they are tagged in very fine detail.  Every single sentence is\\\\r\\\\nmarked, all the registry numbers, all the publications issues, dates, and\\\\r\\\\nvolumes.  No cost figures on tagging material on a per-megabyte basis\\\\r\\\\nwere available.  Because ACS\\\\\\'s typesetting system runs from tagged text,\\\\r\\\\nthere is no extra cost per article.  It was unknown what it costs ACS to\\\\r\\\\nkeyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the\\\\r\\\\ncheapest process.  In other words, since one intends to publish things\\\\r\\\\nand will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case,\\\\r\\\\nif one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but\\\\r\\\\nan electronic system (which is what ACS intends to do--move to SGML\\\\r\\\\npublishing), the marginal cost is zero.  The marginal cost represents the\\\\r\\\\ncost of building tagged text into the database, which is small.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN * Distinction between texts and computers * Implications\\\\r\\\\nof recognizing that all representation is encoding * Dealing with\\\\r\\\\ncomplicated representations of text entails the need for a grammar of\\\\r\\\\ndocuments * Variety of forms of formal grammars * Text as a bit-mapped\\\\r\\\\nimage does not represent a serious attempt to represent text in\\\\r\\\\nelectronic form * SGML, the TEI, document-type declarations, and the\\\\r\\\\nreusability and longevity of data * TEI conformance explicitly allows\\\\r\\\\nextension or modification of the TEI tag set * Administrative background\\\\r\\\\nof the TEI * Several design goals for the TEI tag set * An absolutely\\\\r\\\\nfixed requirement of the TEI Guidelines * Challenges the TEI has\\\\r\\\\nattempted to face * Good texts not beyond economic feasibility * The\\\\r\\\\nissue of reproducibility or processability * The issue of mages as\\\\r\\\\nsimulacra for the text redux * One\\\\\\'s model of text determines what one\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nsoftware can do with a text and has economic consequences *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPrior to speaking about SGML and markup, Michael SPERBERG-McQUEEN, editor,\\\\r\\\\nText Encoding Initiative (TEI), University of Illinois-Chicago, first drew\\\\r\\\\na distinction between texts and computers:  Texts are abstract cultural\\\\r\\\\nand linguistic objects while computers are complicated physical devices,\\\\r\\\\nhe said.  Abstract objects cannot be placed inside physical devices; with\\\\r\\\\ncomputers one can only represent text and act upon those representations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe recognition that all representation is encoding, SPERBERG-McQUEEN\\\\r\\\\nargued, leads to the recognition of two things:  1) The topic description\\\\r\\\\nfor this session is slightly misleading, because there can be no discussion\\\\r\\\\nof pros and cons of text-coding unless what one means is pros and cons of\\\\r\\\\nworking with text with computers.  2) No text can be represented in a\\\\r\\\\ncomputer without some sort of encoding; images are one way of encoding text,\\\\r\\\\nASCII is another, SGML yet another.  There is no encoding without some\\\\r\\\\ninformation loss, that is, there is no perfect reproduction of a text that\\\\r\\\\nallows one to do away with the original.  Thus, the question becomes,\\\\r\\\\nWhat is the most useful representation of text for a serious work?\\\\r\\\\nThis depends on what kind of serious work one is talking about.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex\\\\r\\\\ninformation and fairly complex manipulation of the textual material.\\\\r\\\\nIn order to use that complicated information, one has to calculate it\\\\r\\\\nslowly or manually and store the result.  It needs to be stored, therefore,\\\\r\\\\nas part of one\\\\\\'s representation of the text.  Thus, one needs to store the\\\\r\\\\nstructure in the text.  To deal with complicated representations of text,\\\\r\\\\none needs somehow to control the complexity of the representation of a text;\\\\r\\\\nthat means one needs a way of finding out whether a document and an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic representation of a document is legal or not; and that\\\\r\\\\nmeans one needs a grammar of documents.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN discussed the variety of forms of formal grammars,\\\\r\\\\nimplicit and explicit, as applied to text, and their capabilities.  He\\\\r\\\\nargued that these grammars correspond to different models of text that\\\\r\\\\ndifferent developers have.  For example, one implicit model of the text\\\\r\\\\nis that there is no internal structure, but just one thing after another,\\\\r\\\\na few characters and then perhaps a start-title command, and then a few\\\\r\\\\nmore characters and an end-title command.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN also\\\\r\\\\ndistinguished several kinds of text that have a sort of hierarchical\\\\r\\\\nstructure that is not very well defined, which, typically, corresponds\\\\r\\\\nto grammars that are not very well defined, as well as hierarchies that\\\\r\\\\nare very well defined (e.g., the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae) and extremely\\\\r\\\\ncomplicated things such as SGML, which handle strictly hierarchical data\\\\r\\\\nvery nicely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN conceded that one other model not illustrated on his two\\\\r\\\\ndisplays was the model of text as a bit-mapped image, an image of a page,\\\\r\\\\nand confessed to having been converted to a limited extent by the\\\\r\\\\nWorkshop to the view that electronic images constitute a promising,\\\\r\\\\nprobably superior alternative to microfilming.  But he was not convinced\\\\r\\\\nthat electronic images represent a serious attempt to represent text in\\\\r\\\\nelectronic form.  Many of their problems stem from the fact that they are\\\\r\\\\nnot direct attempts to represent the text but attempts to represent the\\\\r\\\\npage, thus making them representations of representations.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn this situation of increasingly complicated textual information and the\\\\r\\\\nneed to control that complexity in a useful way (which begs the question\\\\r\\\\nof the need for good textual grammars), one has the introduction of SGML.\\\\r\\\\nWith SGML, one can develop specific document-type declarations\\\\r\\\\nfor specific text types or, as with the TEI, attempts to generate\\\\r\\\\ngeneral document-type declarations that can handle all sorts of text.\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI is an attempt to develop formats for text representation that\\\\r\\\\nwill ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier.\\\\r\\\\nIt offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological\\\\r\\\\nrevolution.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt has been a continuing challenge in the TEI to create document grammars\\\\r\\\\nthat do some work in controlling the complexity of the textual object but\\\\r\\\\nalso allowing one to represent the real text that one will find.\\\\r\\\\nFundamental to the notion of the TEI is that TEI conformance allows one\\\\r\\\\nthe ability to extend or modify the TEI tag set so that it fits the text\\\\r\\\\nthat one is attempting to represent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN next outlined the administrative background of the TEI.\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI is an international project to develop and disseminate guidelines\\\\r\\\\nfor the encoding and interchange of machine-readable text.  It is\\\\r\\\\nsponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities, the\\\\r\\\\nAssociation for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for\\\\r\\\\nLiterary and Linguistic Computing.  Representatives of numerous other\\\\r\\\\nprofessional societies sit on its advisory board.  The TEI has a number\\\\r\\\\nof affiliated projects that have provided assistance by testing drafts of\\\\r\\\\nthe guidelines.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong the design goals for the TEI tag set, the scheme first of all must\\\\r\\\\nmeet the needs of research, because the TEI came out of the research\\\\r\\\\ncommunity, which did not feel adequately served by existing tag sets.\\\\r\\\\nThe tag set must be extensive as well as compatible with existing and\\\\r\\\\nemerging standards.  In 1990, version 1.0 of the Guidelines was released\\\\r\\\\n(SPERBERG-McQUEEN illustrated their contents).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that one problem besetting electronic text has\\\\r\\\\nbeen the lack of adequate internal or external documentation for many\\\\r\\\\nexisting electronic texts.  The TEI guidelines as currently formulated\\\\r\\\\ncontain few fixed requirements, but one of them is this:  There must\\\\r\\\\nalways be a document header, an in-file SGML tag that provides\\\\r\\\\n1) a bibliographic description of the electronic object one is talking\\\\r\\\\nabout (that is, who included it, when, what for, and under which title);\\\\r\\\\nand 2) the copy text from which it was derived, if any.  If there was\\\\r\\\\nno copy text or if the copy text is unknown, then one states as much.\\\\r\\\\nVersion 2.0 of the Guidelines was scheduled to be completed in fall 1992\\\\r\\\\nand a revised third version is to be presented to the TEI advisory board\\\\r\\\\nfor its endorsement this coming winter.  The TEI itself exists to provide\\\\r\\\\na markup language, not a marked-up text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAmong the challenges the TEI has attempted to face is the need for a\\\\r\\\\nmarkup language that will work for existing projects, that is, handle the\\\\r\\\\nlevel of markup that people are using now to tag only chapter, section,\\\\r\\\\nand paragraph divisions and not much else.  At the same time, such a\\\\r\\\\nlanguage also will be able to scale up gracefully to handle the highly\\\\r\\\\ndetailed markup which many people foresee as the future destination of\\\\r\\\\nmuch electronic text, and which is not the future destination but the\\\\r\\\\npresent home of numerous electronic texts in specialized areas.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN dismissed the lowest-common-denominator approach as\\\\r\\\\nunable to support the kind of applications that draw people who have\\\\r\\\\nnever been in the public library regularly before, and make them come\\\\r\\\\nback.  He advocated more interesting text and more intelligent text.\\\\r\\\\nAsserting that it is not beyond economic feasibility to have good texts,\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that the TEI Guidelines listing 200-odd tags\\\\r\\\\ncontains tags that one is expected to enter every time the relevant\\\\r\\\\ntextual feature occurs.  It contains all the tags that people need now,\\\\r\\\\nand it is not expected that everyone will tag things in the same way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe question of how people will tag the text is in large part a function\\\\r\\\\nof their reaction to what SPERBERG-McQUEEN termed the issue of\\\\r\\\\nreproducibility.  What one needs to be able to reproduce are the things\\\\r\\\\none wants to work with.  Perhaps a more useful concept than that of\\\\r\\\\nreproducibility or recoverability is that of processability, that is,\\\\r\\\\nwhat can one get from an electronic text without reading it again\\\\r\\\\nin the original.  He illustrated this contention with a page from\\\\r\\\\nJan Comenius\\\\\\'s bilingual Introduction to Latin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN returned at length to the issue of images as simulacra\\\\r\\\\nfor the text, in order to reiterate his belief that in the long run more\\\\r\\\\nthan images of pages of particular editions of the text are needed,\\\\r\\\\nbecause just as second-generation photocopies and second-generation\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm degenerate, so second-generation representations tend to\\\\r\\\\ndegenerate, and one tends to overstress some relatively trivial aspects\\\\r\\\\nof the text such as its layout on the page, which is not always\\\\r\\\\nsignificant, despite what the text critics might say, and slight other\\\\r\\\\npieces of information such as the very important lexical ties between the\\\\r\\\\nEnglish and Latin versions of Comenius\\\\\\'s bilingual text, for example.\\\\r\\\\nMoreover, in many crucial respects it is easy to fool oneself concerning\\\\r\\\\nwhat a scanned image of the text will accomplish.  For example, in order\\\\r\\\\nto study the transmission of texts, information concerning the text\\\\r\\\\ncarrier is necessary, which scanned images simply do not always handle.\\\\r\\\\nFurther, even the high-quality materials being produced at Cornell use\\\\r\\\\nmuch of the information that one would need if studying those books as\\\\r\\\\nphysical objects.  It is a choice that has been made.  It is an arguably\\\\r\\\\njustifiable choice, but one does not know what color those pen strokes in\\\\r\\\\nthe margin are or whether there was a stain on the page, because it has\\\\r\\\\nbeen filtered out.  One does not know whether there were rips in the page\\\\r\\\\nbecause they do not show up, and on a couple of the marginal marks one\\\\r\\\\nloses half of the mark because the pen is very light and the scanner\\\\r\\\\nfailed to pick it up, and so what is clearly a checkmark in the margin of\\\\r\\\\nthe original becomes a little scoop in the margin of the facsimile.\\\\r\\\\nStandard problems for facsimile editions, not new to electronics, but\\\\r\\\\nalso true of light-lens photography, and are remarked here because it is\\\\r\\\\nimportant that we not fool ourselves that even if we produce a very nice\\\\r\\\\nimage of this page with good contrast, we are not replacing the\\\\r\\\\nmanuscript any more than microfilm has replaced the manuscript.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI comes from the research community, where its first allegiance\\\\r\\\\nlies, but it is not just an academic exercise.  It has relevance far\\\\r\\\\nbeyond those who spend all of their time studying text, because one\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nmodel of text determines what one\\\\\\'s software can do with a text.  Good\\\\r\\\\nmodels lead to good software.  Bad models lead to bad software.  That has\\\\r\\\\neconomic consequences, and it is these economic consequences that have\\\\r\\\\nled the European Community to help support the TEI, and that will lead,\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN hoped, some software vendors to realize that if they\\\\r\\\\nprovide software with a better model of the text they can make a killing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Implications of different DTDs and tag sets * ODA versus SGML *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the discussion that followed, several additional points were made.\\\\r\\\\nNeither AAP (i.e., Association of American Publishers) nor CALS (i.e.,\\\\r\\\\nComputer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support) has a document-type\\\\r\\\\ndefinition for ancient Greek drama, although the TEI will be able to\\\\r\\\\nhandle that.  Given this state of affairs and assuming that the\\\\r\\\\ntechnical-journal producers and the commercial vendors decide to use the\\\\r\\\\nother two types, then an institution like the Library of Congress, which\\\\r\\\\nmight receive all of their publications, would have to be able to handle\\\\r\\\\nthree different types of document definitions and tag sets and be able to\\\\r\\\\ndistinguish among them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOffice Document Architecture (ODA) has some advantages that flow from its\\\\r\\\\ntight focus on office documents and clear directions for implementation.\\\\r\\\\nMuch of the ODA standard is easier to read and clearer at first reading\\\\r\\\\nthan the SGML standard, which is extremely general.  What that means is\\\\r\\\\nthat if one wants to use graphics in TIFF and ODA, one is stuck, because\\\\r\\\\nODA defines graphics formats while TIFF does not, whereas SGML says the\\\\r\\\\nworld is not waiting for this work group to create another graphics format.\\\\r\\\\nWhat is needed is an ability to use whatever graphics format one wants.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI provides a socket that allows one to connect the SGML document to\\\\r\\\\nthe graphics.  The notation that the graphics are in is clearly a choice\\\\r\\\\nthat one needs to make based on her or his environment, and that is one\\\\r\\\\nadvantage.  SGML is less megalomaniacal in attempting to define formats\\\\r\\\\nfor all kinds of information, though more megalomaniacal in attempting to\\\\r\\\\ncover all sorts of documents.  The other advantage is that the model of\\\\r\\\\ntext represented by SGML is simply an order of magnitude richer and more\\\\r\\\\nflexible than the model of text offered by ODA.  Both offer hierarchical\\\\r\\\\nstructures, but SGML recognizes that the hierarchical model of the text\\\\r\\\\nthat one is looking at may not have been in the minds of the designers,\\\\r\\\\nwhereas ODA does not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nODA is not really aiming for the kind of document that the TEI wants to\\\\r\\\\nencompass.  The TEI can handle the kind of material ODA has, as well as a\\\\r\\\\nsignificantly broader range of material.  ODA seems to be very much\\\\r\\\\nfocused on office documents, which is what it started out being called--\\\\r\\\\noffice document architecture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA * Text-encoding from a publisher\\\\\\'s perspective *\\\\r\\\\nResponsibilities of a publisher * Reproduction of Migne\\\\\\'s Latin series\\\\r\\\\nwhole and complete with SGML tags based on perceived need and expected\\\\r\\\\nuse * Particular decisions arising from the general decision to produce\\\\r\\\\nand publish PLD *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe final speaker in this session, Eric CALALUCA, vice president,\\\\r\\\\nChadwyck-Healey, Inc., spoke from the perspective of a publisher re\\\\r\\\\ntext-encoding, rather than as one qualified to discuss methods of\\\\r\\\\nencoding data, and observed that the presenters sitting in the room,\\\\r\\\\nwhether they had chosen to or not, were acting as publishers:  making\\\\r\\\\nchoices, gathering data, gathering information, and making assessments.\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA offered the hard-won conviction that in publishing very large\\\\r\\\\ntext files (such as PLD), one cannot avoid making personal judgments of\\\\r\\\\nappropriateness and structure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn CALALUCA\\\\\\'s view, encoding decisions stem from prior judgments.  Two\\\\r\\\\nnotions have become axioms for him in the consideration of future sources\\\\r\\\\nfor electronic publication:  1) electronic text publishing is as personal\\\\r\\\\nas any other kind of publishing, and questions of if and how to encode\\\\r\\\\nthe data are simply a consequence of that prior decision;  2) all\\\\r\\\\npersonal decisions are open to criticism, which is unavoidable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA rehearsed his role as a publisher or, better, as an intermediary\\\\r\\\\nbetween what is viewed as a sound idea and the people who would make use\\\\r\\\\nof it.  Finding the specialist to advise in this process is the core of\\\\r\\\\nthat function.  The publisher must monitor and hug the fine line between\\\\r\\\\ngiving users what they want and suggesting what they might need.  One\\\\r\\\\nresponsibility of a publisher is to represent the desires of scholars and\\\\r\\\\nresearch librarians as opposed to bullheadedly forcing them into areas\\\\r\\\\nthey would not choose to enter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCALALUCA likened the questions being raised today about data structure\\\\r\\\\nand standards to the decisions faced by the Abbe Migne himself during\\\\r\\\\nproduction of the Patrologia series in the mid-nineteenth century.\\\\r\\\\nChadwyck-Healey\\\\\\'s decision to reproduce Migne\\\\\\'s Latin series whole and\\\\r\\\\ncomplete with SGML tags was also based upon a perceived need and an\\\\r\\\\nexpected use.  In the same way that Migne\\\\\\'s work came to be far more than\\\\r\\\\na simple handbook for clerics, PLD is already far more than a database\\\\r\\\\nfor theologians.  It is a bedrock source for the study of Western\\\\r\\\\ncivilization, CALALUCA asserted.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn regard to the decision to produce and publish PLD, the editorial board\\\\r\\\\noffered direct judgments on the question of appropriateness of these\\\\r\\\\ntexts for conversion, their encoding and their distribution, and\\\\r\\\\nconcluded that the best possible project was one that avoided overt\\\\r\\\\nintrusions or exclusions in so important a resource.  Thus, the general\\\\r\\\\ndecision to transmit the original collection as clearly as possible with\\\\r\\\\nthe widest possible avenues for use led to other decisions:  1) To encode\\\\r\\\\nthe data or not, SGML or not, TEI or not.  Again, the expected user\\\\r\\\\ncommunity asserted the need for normative tagging structures of important\\\\r\\\\nhumanities texts, and the TEI seemed the most appropriate structure for\\\\r\\\\nthat purpose.  Research librarians, who are trained to view the larger\\\\r\\\\nimpact of electronic text sources on 80 or 90 or 100 doctoral\\\\r\\\\ndisciplines, loudly approved the decision to include tagging.  They see\\\\r\\\\nwhat is coming better than the specialist who is completely focused on\\\\r\\\\none edition of Ambrose\\\\\\'s De Anima, and they also understand that the\\\\r\\\\npotential uses exceed present expectations.  2) What will be tagged and\\\\r\\\\nwhat will not.  Once again, the board realized that one must tag the\\\\r\\\\nobvious.  But in no way should one attempt to identify through encoding\\\\r\\\\nschemes every single discrete area of a text that might someday be\\\\r\\\\nsearched.  That was another decision.  Searching by a column number, an\\\\r\\\\nauthor, a word, a volume, permitting combination searches, and tagging\\\\r\\\\nnotations seemed logical choices as core elements.  3) How does one make\\\\r\\\\nthe data available?  Tieing it to a CD-ROM edition creates limitations,\\\\r\\\\nbut a magnetic tape file that is very large, is accompanied by the\\\\r\\\\nencoding specifications, and that allows one to make local modifications\\\\r\\\\nalso allows one to incorporate any changes one may desire within the\\\\r\\\\nbounds of private research, though exporting tag files from a CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\ncould serve just as well.  Since no one on the board could possibly\\\\r\\\\nanticipate each and every way in which a scholar might choose to mine\\\\r\\\\nthis data bank, it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some\\\\r\\\\nprovisions for what might come.  4) Not to encode the database would rob\\\\r\\\\nit of the interchangeability and portability these important texts should\\\\r\\\\naccommodate.  For CALALUCA, the extensive options presented by full-text\\\\r\\\\nsearching require care in text selection and strongly support encoding of\\\\r\\\\ndata to facilitate the widest possible search strategies.  Better\\\\r\\\\nsoftware can always be created, but summoning the resources, the people,\\\\r\\\\nand the energy to reconvert the text is another matter.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPLD is being encoded, captured, and distributed, because to\\\\r\\\\nChadwyck-Healey and the board it offers the widest possible array of\\\\r\\\\nfuture research applications that can be seen today.  CALALUCA concluded\\\\r\\\\nby urging the encoding of all important text sources in whatever way\\\\r\\\\nseems most appropriate and durable at the time, without blanching at the\\\\r\\\\nthought that one\\\\\\'s work may require emendation in the future.  (Thus,\\\\r\\\\nChadwyck-Healey produced a very large humanities text database before the\\\\r\\\\nfinal release of the TEI Guidelines.)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\nDISCUSSION * Creating texts with markup advocated * Trends in encoding *\\\\r\\\\nThe TEI and the issue of interchangeability of standards * A\\\\r\\\\nmisconception concerning the TEI * Implications for an institution like\\\\r\\\\nLC in the event that a multiplicity of DTDs develops * Producing images\\\\r\\\\nas a first step towards possible conversion to full text through\\\\r\\\\ncharacter recognition * The AAP tag sets as a common starting point and\\\\r\\\\nthe need for caution *\\\\r\\\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY prefaced the discussion that followed with several comments in\\\\r\\\\nfavor of creating texts with markup and on trends in encoding.  In the\\\\r\\\\nfuture, when many more texts are available for on-line searching, real\\\\r\\\\nproblems in finding what is wanted will develop, if one is faced with\\\\r\\\\nmillions of words of data.  It therefore becomes important to consider\\\\r\\\\nputting markup in texts to help searchers home in on the actual things\\\\r\\\\nthey wish to retrieve.  Various approaches to refining retrieval methods\\\\r\\\\ntoward this end include building on a computer version of a dictionary\\\\r\\\\nand letting the computer look up words in it to obtain more information\\\\r\\\\nabout the semantic structure or semantic field of a word, its grammatical\\\\r\\\\nstructure, and syntactic structure.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY commented on the present keen interest in the encoding world\\\\r\\\\nin creating:  1) machine-readable versions of dictionaries that can be\\\\r\\\\ninitially tagged in SGML, which gives a structure to the dictionary entry;\\\\r\\\\nthese entries can then be converted into a more rigid or otherwise\\\\r\\\\ndifferent database structure inside the computer, which can be treated as\\\\r\\\\na dynamic tool for searching mechanisms; 2) large bodies of text to study\\\\r\\\\nthe language.  In order to incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms,\\\\r\\\\nmore about how words behave needs to be known, which can be learned in\\\\r\\\\npart from information in dictionaries.  However, the last ten years have\\\\r\\\\nseen much interest in studying the structure of printed dictionaries\\\\r\\\\nconverted into computer-readable form.  The information one derives about\\\\r\\\\nmany words from those is only partial, one or two definitions of the\\\\r\\\\ncommon or the usual meaning of a word, and then numerous definitions of\\\\r\\\\nunusual usages.  If the computer is using a dictionary to help retrieve\\\\r\\\\nwords in a text, it needs much more information about the common usages,\\\\r\\\\nbecause those are the ones that occur over and over again.  Hence the\\\\r\\\\ncurrent interest in developing large bodies of text in computer-readable\\\\r\\\\nform in order to study the language.  Several projects are engaged in\\\\r\\\\ncompiling, for example, 100 million words. HOCKEY described one with\\\\r\\\\nwhich she was associated briefly at Oxford University involving\\\\r\\\\ncompilation of 100 million words of British English:  about 10 percent of\\\\r\\\\nthat will contain detailed linguistic tagging encoded in SGML; it will\\\\r\\\\nhave word class taggings, with words identified as nouns, verbs,\\\\r\\\\nadjectives, or other parts of speech.  This tagging can then be used by\\\\r\\\\nprograms which will begin to learn a bit more about the structure of the\\\\r\\\\nlanguage, and then, can go to tag more text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY said that the more that is tagged accurately, the more one can\\\\r\\\\nrefine the tagging process and thus the bigger body of text one can build\\\\r\\\\nup with linguistic tagging incorporated into it.  Hence, the more tagging\\\\r\\\\nor annotation there is in the text, the more one may begin to learn about\\\\r\\\\nlanguage and the more it will help accomplish more intelligent OCR.  She\\\\r\\\\nrecommended the development of software tools that will help one begin to\\\\r\\\\nunderstand more about a text, which can then be applied to scanning\\\\r\\\\nimages of that text in that format and to using more intelligence to help\\\\r\\\\none interpret or understand the text.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY posited the need to think about common methods of text-encoding\\\\r\\\\nfor a long time to come, because building these large bodies of text is\\\\r\\\\nextremely expensive and will only be done once.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the more general discussion on approaches to encoding that followed,\\\\r\\\\nthese points were made:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER identified the underlying problem with standards that all have to\\\\r\\\\nstruggle with in adopting a standard, namely, the tension between a very\\\\r\\\\nhighly defined standard that is very interchangeable but does not work\\\\r\\\\nfor everyone because something is lacking, and a standard that is less\\\\r\\\\ndefined, more open, more adaptable, but less interchangeable.  Contending\\\\r\\\\nthat the way in which people use SGML is not sufficiently defined, BESSER\\\\r\\\\nwondered 1) if people resist the TEI because they think it is too defined\\\\r\\\\nin certain things they do not fit into, and 2) how progress with\\\\r\\\\ninterchangeability can be made without frightening people away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN replied that the published drafts of the TEI had met\\\\r\\\\nwith surprisingly little objection on the grounds that they do not allow\\\\r\\\\none to handle X or Y or Z.  Particular concerns of the affiliated\\\\r\\\\nprojects have led, in practice, to discussions of how extensions are to\\\\r\\\\nbe made; the primary concern of any project has to be how it can be\\\\r\\\\nrepresented locally, thus making interchange secondary.  The TEI has\\\\r\\\\nreceived much criticism based on the notion that everything in it is\\\\r\\\\nrequired or even recommended, which, as it happens, is a misconception\\\\r\\\\nfrom the beginning,   because none of it is required and very little is\\\\r\\\\nactually actively recommended for all cases, except that one document\\\\r\\\\none\\\\\\'s source.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed with BESSER about this trade-off:  all the\\\\r\\\\nprojects in a set of twenty TEI-conformant projects will not necessarily\\\\r\\\\ntag the material in the same way.  One result of the TEI will be that the\\\\r\\\\neasiest problems will be solved--those dealing with the external form of\\\\r\\\\nthe information; but the problem that is hardest in interchange is that\\\\r\\\\none is not encoding what another wants, and vice versa.  Thus, after\\\\r\\\\nthe adoption of a common notation, the differences in the underlying\\\\r\\\\nconceptions of what is interesting about texts become more visible.\\\\r\\\\nThe success of a standard like the TEI will lie in the ability of\\\\r\\\\nthe recipient of interchanged texts to use some of what it contains\\\\r\\\\nand to add the information that was not encoded that one wants, in a\\\\r\\\\nlayered way, so that texts can be gradually enriched and one does not\\\\r\\\\nhave to put in everything all at once.  Hence, having a well-behaved\\\\r\\\\nmarkup scheme is important.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSTEVENS followed up on the paradoxical analogy that BESSER alluded to in\\\\r\\\\nthe example of the MARC records, namely, the formats that are the same\\\\r\\\\nexcept that they are different.  STEVENS drew a parallel between\\\\r\\\\ndocument-type definitions and MARC records for books and serials and maps,\\\\r\\\\nwhere one has a tagging structure and there is a text-interchange.\\\\r\\\\nSTEVENS opined that the producers of the information will set the terms\\\\r\\\\nfor the standard (i.e., develop document-type definitions for the users\\\\r\\\\nof their products), creating a situation that will be problematical for\\\\r\\\\nan institution like the Library of Congress, which will have to deal with\\\\r\\\\nthe DTDs in the event that a multiplicity of them develops.  Thus,\\\\r\\\\nnumerous people are seeking a standard but cannot find the tag set that\\\\r\\\\nwill be acceptable to them and their clients.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed\\\\r\\\\nwith this view, and said that the situation was in a way worse:  attempting\\\\r\\\\nto unify arbitrary DTDs resembled attempting to unify a MARC record with a\\\\r\\\\nbibliographic record done according to the Prussian instructions.\\\\r\\\\nAccording to STEVENS, this situation occurred very early in the process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWATERS recalled from early discussions on Project Open Book the concern\\\\r\\\\nof many people that merely by producing images, POB was not really\\\\r\\\\nenhancing intellectual access to the material.  Nevertheless, not wishing\\\\r\\\\nto overemphasize the opposition between imaging and full text, WATERS\\\\r\\\\nstated that POB views getting the images as a first step toward possibly\\\\r\\\\nconverting to full text through character recognition, if the technology\\\\r\\\\nis appropriate.  WATERS also emphasized that encoding is involved even\\\\r\\\\nwith a set of images.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed with WATERS that one can create an SGML document\\\\r\\\\nconsisting wholly of images.  At first sight, organizing graphic images\\\\r\\\\nwith an SGML document may not seem to offer great advantages, but the\\\\r\\\\nadvantages of the scheme WATERS described would be precisely that\\\\r\\\\nability to move into something that is more of a multimedia document:\\\\r\\\\na combination of transcribed text and page images.  WEIBEL concurred in\\\\r\\\\nthis judgment, offering evidence from Project ADAPT, where a page is\\\\r\\\\ndivided into text elements and graphic elements, and in fact the text\\\\r\\\\nelements are organized by columns and lines.  These lines may be used as\\\\r\\\\nthe basis for distributing documents in a network environment.  As one\\\\r\\\\ndevelops software intelligent enough to recognize what those elements\\\\r\\\\nare, it makes sense to apply SGML to an image initially, that may, in\\\\r\\\\nfact, ultimately become more and more text, either through OCR or edited\\\\r\\\\nOCR or even just through keying.  For WATERS, the labor of composing the\\\\r\\\\ndocument and saying this set of documents or this set of images belongs\\\\r\\\\nto this document constitutes a significant investment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL also made the point that the AAP tag sets, while not excessively\\\\r\\\\nprescriptive, offer a common starting point; they do not define the\\\\r\\\\nstructure of the documents, though.  They have some recommendations about\\\\r\\\\nDTDs one could use as examples, but they do just suggest tag sets.   For\\\\r\\\\nexample, the CORE project attempts to use the AAP markup as much as\\\\r\\\\npossible, but there are clearly areas where structure must be added.\\\\r\\\\nThat in no way contradicts the use of AAP tag sets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that the TEI prepared a long working paper early\\\\r\\\\non about the AAP tag set and what it lacked that the TEI thought it\\\\r\\\\nneeded, and a fairly long critique of the naming conventions, which has\\\\r\\\\nled to a very different style of naming in the TEI.  He stressed the\\\\r\\\\nimportance of the opposition between prescriptive markup, the kind that a\\\\r\\\\npublisher or anybody can do when producing documents de novo, and\\\\r\\\\ndescriptive markup, in which one has to take what the text carrier\\\\r\\\\nprovides.  In these particular tag sets it is easy to overemphasize this\\\\r\\\\nopposition, because the AAP tag set is extremely flexible.  Even if one\\\\r\\\\njust used the DTDs, they allow almost anything to appear almost anywhere.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION VI.

Re foreign laws, very frequently a\\\\r\\\\n     work can be in the public domain in the United States but protected\\\\r\\\\n     in other countries.  Thus, one must consider all of the places a\\\\r\\\\n     work may reach, lest one unwittingly become liable to being faced\\\\r\\\\n     with a suit for copyright infringement, or at least a letter\\\\r\\\\n     demanding discussion of what one is doing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States.  The U.S.\\\\r\\\\nConstitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact\\\\r\\\\ncopyright laws for two purposes:  1) to encourage the creation and\\\\r\\\\ndissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole;\\\\r\\\\nand, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and\\\\r\\\\ndisseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCongress strives to strike a balance, which at times can become an\\\\r\\\\nemotional issue.  The United States has never accepted the notion of the\\\\r\\\\nnatural right of an author so much as it has accepted the notion of the\\\\r\\\\npublic good and the desirability of incentives to promote it.  This state\\\\r\\\\nof affairs, however, has created strains on the international level and\\\\r\\\\nis the reason for several of the differences in the laws that we have.\\\\r\\\\nToday the United States protects almost every kind of work that can be\\\\r\\\\ncalled an expression of an author.  The standard for gaining copyright\\\\r\\\\nprotection is simply originality.  This is a low standard and means that\\\\r\\\\na work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain\\\\r\\\\nminimal amount of authorship.  One can also acquire copyright protection\\\\r\\\\nfor making a new version of preexisting material, provided it manifests\\\\r\\\\nsome spark of creativity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHowever, copyright does not protect ideas, methods, systems--only the way\\\\r\\\\nthat one expresses those things.  Nor does copyright protect anything\\\\r\\\\nthat is mechanical, anything that does not involve choice, or criteria\\\\r\\\\nconcerning whether or not one should do a thing.  For example, the\\\\r\\\\nresults of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes\\\\r\\\\nimpure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable.  On the other\\\\r\\\\nhand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of\\\\r\\\\nviolins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion\\\\r\\\\nthat are copyrightable.  Moreover, if a work is protected by copyright in\\\\r\\\\nthe United States, one generally needs the permission of the copyright\\\\r\\\\nowner to convert it.  Normally, who will own the new--that is, converted-\\\\r\\\\n-material is a matter of contract.  In the absence of a contract, the\\\\r\\\\nperson who creates the new material is the author and owner.  But people\\\\r\\\\ndo not generally think about the copyright implications until after the\\\\r\\\\nfact.  PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to\\\\r\\\\nthink about copyright in advance.  One\\\\\\'s bargaining power is much greater\\\\r\\\\nup front than it is down the road.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPETERS next discussed works not protected by copyright, for example, any\\\\r\\\\nwork done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is\\\\r\\\\nin the public domain in the United States.  The issue is not wholly free\\\\r\\\\nof doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain\\\\r\\\\noutside the United States.  Other materials in the public domain include:\\\\r\\\\nany works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work\\\\r\\\\npublished in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose\\\\r\\\\ncopyright was not renewed.  In talking about the new technology and\\\\r\\\\nputting material in a digital form to send all over the world, PETERS\\\\r\\\\ncautioned, one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an\\\\r\\\\nissue in the United States, they may be in different parts of the world,\\\\r\\\\nwhere most countries previously employed a copyright term of the life of\\\\r\\\\nthe author plus fifty years.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPETERS next reviewed the economics of copyright holding.  Simply,\\\\r\\\\neconomic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in\\\\r\\\\nany form.  They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for\\\\r\\\\nhire, the employer.  The second right, which is critical to conversion,\\\\r\\\\nis the right to change a work.  The right to make new versions is perhaps\\\\r\\\\none of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic world.  The third right is the right to publish the work and\\\\r\\\\nthe right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic medium needs to know.  The basic rule is if a copy is sold,\\\\r\\\\nall rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy.\\\\r\\\\nThe key is that it must be sold.  A number of companies overcome this\\\\r\\\\nobstacle by leasing or renting their product.  These companies argue that\\\\r\\\\nif the material is rented or leased and not sold, they control the uses\\\\r\\\\nof a work.  The fourth right, and one very important in a digital world,\\\\r\\\\nis a right of public performance, which means the right to show the work\\\\r\\\\nsequentially.  For example, copyright owners control the showing of a\\\\r\\\\nCD-ROM product in a public place such as a public library.  The reverse\\\\r\\\\nside of public performance is something called the right of public\\\\r\\\\ndisplay.  Moral rights also exist, which at the federal level apply only\\\\r\\\\nto very limited visual works of art, but in theory may apply under\\\\r\\\\ncontract and other principles.  Moral rights may include the right of an\\\\r\\\\nauthor to have his or her name on a work, the right of attribution, and\\\\r\\\\nthe right to object to distortion or mutilation--the right of integrity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe way copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as\\\\r\\\\npreservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when\\\\r\\\\nthe user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of\\\\r\\\\nfacsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and\\\\r\\\\nother libraries.  But the law does not allow anyone to become the\\\\r\\\\ndistributor of the product for the entire world.  In today\\\\\\'s electronic\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is\\\\r\\\\nnetworked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a\\\\r\\\\nsingle library.  Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers\\\\r\\\\nmay choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for\\\\r\\\\nexample, from access and use.  Hence, the development of site licenses\\\\r\\\\nand other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they\\\\r\\\\nshould be compensated for.  Any solution that the United States takes\\\\r\\\\ntoday has to consider the international arena.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNoting that the United States is a member of the Berne Convention and\\\\r\\\\nsubscribes to its provisions, PETERS described the permissions process.\\\\r\\\\nShe also defined compulsory licenses.  A compulsory license, of which the\\\\r\\\\nUnited States has had a few, builds into the law the right to use a work\\\\r\\\\nsubject to certain terms and conditions.  In the international arena,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, the ability to use compulsory licenses is extremely limited.\\\\r\\\\nThus, clearinghouses and other collectives comprise one option that has\\\\r\\\\nsucceeded in providing for use of a work.  Often overlooked when one\\\\r\\\\nbegins to use copyrighted material and put products together is how\\\\r\\\\nexpensive the permissions process and managing it is.  According to\\\\r\\\\nPETERS, the price of copyright in a digital medium, whatever solution is\\\\r\\\\nworked out, will include managing and assembling the database.  She\\\\r\\\\nstrongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with\\\\r\\\\nvarious backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible\\\\r\\\\nsystems, in order to produce better results.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the lengthy question-and-answer period that followed PETERS\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\npresentation, the following points emerged:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and\\\\r\\\\n     totally exhaustive probably is not protected.  In the event that\\\\r\\\\n     what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable\\\\r\\\\n     material is not understood, the Copyright Office will ask about the\\\\r\\\\n     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make.  As a\\\\r\\\\n     practical matter, if one believes she or he has made enough of those\\\\r\\\\n     choices, that person has a right to assert a copyright and someone\\\\r\\\\n     else must assert that the work is not copyrightable.  The more\\\\r\\\\n     mechanical, the more automatic, a thing is, the less likely it is to\\\\r\\\\n     be copyrightable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Nearly all photographs are deemed to be copyrightable, but no one\\\\r\\\\n     worries about them much, because everyone is free to take the same\\\\r\\\\n     image.  Thus, a photographic copyright represents what is called a\\\\r\\\\n     \"thin\" copyright.  The photograph itself must be duplicated, in\\\\r\\\\n     order for copyright to be violated.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * The Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not\\\\r\\\\n     copyrightable because they are mechanical.  It  can be argued\\\\r\\\\n     whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected.  One\\\\r\\\\n     must exercise care with material created with public funds and\\\\r\\\\n     generally in the public domain.  An article written by a federal\\\\r\\\\n     employee, if written as part of official duties, is not\\\\r\\\\n     copyrightable.  However, control over a scientific article written\\\\r\\\\n     by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who\\\\r\\\\n     receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy.  If\\\\r\\\\n     the government agency has no policy (and that policy can be\\\\r\\\\n     contained in its regulations, the contract, or the grant), the\\\\r\\\\n     author retains copyright.  If a provision of the contract, grant, or\\\\r\\\\n     regulation states that there will be no copyright, then it does not\\\\r\\\\n     exist.  When a work is created, copyright automatically comes into\\\\r\\\\n     existence unless something exists that says it does not.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * An enhanced electronic copy of a print copy of an older reference\\\\r\\\\n     work in the public domain that does not contain copyrightable new\\\\r\\\\n     material is a purely mechanical rendition of the original work, and\\\\r\\\\n     is not copyrightable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Usually, when a work enters the public domain, nothing can remove\\\\r\\\\n     it.  For example, Congress recently passed into law the concept of\\\\r\\\\n     automatic renewal, which means that copyright on any work published\\\\r\\\\n     between l964 and l978 does not have to be renewed in order to\\\\r\\\\n     receive a seventy-five-year term.  But any work not renewed before\\\\r\\\\n     1964 is in the public domain.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Concerning whether or not the United States keeps track of when\\\\r\\\\n     authors die, nothing was ever done, nor is anything being done at\\\\r\\\\n     the moment by the Copyright Office.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     * Software that drives a mechanical process is itself copyrightable.\\\\r\\\\n     If one changes platforms, the software itself has a copyright.  The\\\\r\\\\n     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 28\\\\r\\\\n     March through 2 April l993, at Harvard University, on digital\\\\r\\\\n     technology, and will study this entire issue.  If one purchases a\\\\r\\\\n     computer software package, such as MacPaint, and creates something\\\\r\\\\n     new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPETERS added that often in copyright matters, rough justice is the\\\\r\\\\noutcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American\\\\r\\\\nSociety of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast\\\\r\\\\nMusic, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their\\\\r\\\\ndue.  Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without\\\\r\\\\npaying for it; there should be some compensation.  But the truth of the\\\\r\\\\nworld, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on\\\\r\\\\nthe radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more\\\\r\\\\nuntil he becomes a big guy.  That is true of every author, every\\\\r\\\\ncomposer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCopyright always originates with the author, except in cases of works\\\\r\\\\nmade for hire.  (Most software falls into this category.)  When an author\\\\r\\\\nsends his article to a journal, he has not relinquished copyright, though\\\\r\\\\nhe retains the right to relinquish it.  The author receives absolutely\\\\r\\\\neverything.  The less prominent the author, the more leverage the\\\\r\\\\npublisher will have in contract negotiations.  In order to transfer the\\\\r\\\\nrights, the author must sign an agreement giving them away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn an electronic society, it is important to be able to license a writer\\\\r\\\\nand work out deals.  With regard to use of a work, it usually is much\\\\r\\\\neasier when a publisher holds the rights.  In an electronic era, a real\\\\r\\\\nproblem arises when one is digitizing and making information available.\\\\r\\\\nPETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses.  Copyright\\\\r\\\\nought to remain with the author, but as one moves forward globally in the\\\\r\\\\nelectronic arena, a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes\\\\r\\\\nincreasingly necessary.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but\\\\r\\\\nin an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with\\\\r\\\\nby many individuals, there is concern.  If changes are authorized and\\\\r\\\\nthere is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns\\\\r\\\\nthe changes.  To put it another way, the person who acquires permission\\\\r\\\\nto change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless\\\\r\\\\nsome agreement to the contrary has been made.  It is typical for the\\\\r\\\\noriginal publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the\\\\r\\\\nuses.  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries.  Anything can be\\\\r\\\\nchanged by contract.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                 ******\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION VII.

And, if\\\\r\\\\nso, what are they and who might take them?  2) Partly derivative from\\\\r\\\\nthat, but obviously very dangerous to LC as host, do you see a role for\\\\r\\\\nthe Library of Congress in all this?  Of course, the Library of Congress\\\\r\\\\nholds a rather special status in a number of these matters, because it is\\\\r\\\\nnot perceived as a player with an economic stake in them, but are there\\\\r\\\\nroles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDescribing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the\\\\r\\\\nlast two days, GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop:\\\\r\\\\n1) people who are very deeply committed to text; 2) people who are almost\\\\r\\\\npassionate about images; and 3) a few people who are very committed to\\\\r\\\\nwhat happens to the networks.  In other words, the new networking\\\\r\\\\ndimension, the accessibility of the processability, the portability of\\\\r\\\\nall this across the networks.  How do we pull those three together?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAdding a question that reflected HOCKEY\\\\\\'s comment that this was the\\\\r\\\\nfourth workshop she had attended in the previous thirty days, FLEISCHHAUER\\\\r\\\\nwondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel, or if it\\\\r\\\\nhad contributed anything in the way of bringing together a different group\\\\r\\\\nof people from those who normally appear on the workshop circuit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY confessed to being struck at this meeting and the one the\\\\r\\\\nElectronic Pierce Consortium organized the previous week that this was a\\\\r\\\\ncoming together of people working on texts and not images.  Attempting to\\\\r\\\\nbring the two together is something we ought to be thinking about for the\\\\r\\\\nfuture:  How one can think about working with image material to begin\\\\r\\\\nwith, but structuring it and digitizing it in such a way that at a later\\\\r\\\\nstage it can be interpreted into text, and find a common way of building\\\\r\\\\ntext and images together so that they can be used jointly in the future,\\\\r\\\\nwith the network support to begin there because that is how people will\\\\r\\\\nwant to access it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn planning the long-term development of something, which is what is\\\\r\\\\nbeing done in electronic text, HOCKEY stressed the importance not only\\\\r\\\\nof discussing the technical aspects of how one does it but particularly\\\\r\\\\nof thinking about what the people who use the stuff will want to do.\\\\r\\\\nBut conversely, there are numerous things that people start to do with\\\\r\\\\nelectronic text or material that nobody ever thought of in the beginning.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK, in response to the question concerning the role of the Library of\\\\r\\\\nCongress, remarked the often suggested desideratum of having electronic\\\\r\\\\ndeposit:  Since everything is now computer-typeset, an entire decade of\\\\r\\\\nmaterial that was machine-readable exists, but the publishers frequently\\\\r\\\\ndid not save it; has LC taken any action to have its copyright deposit\\\\r\\\\noperation start collecting these machine-readable versions?  In the\\\\r\\\\nabsence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being\\\\r\\\\nactively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem.\\\\r\\\\nAnother dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original\\\\r\\\\nelectronic document.  It becomes highly important in science to prove\\\\r\\\\nauthorship.  How will that be done?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nERWAY explained that, under the old policy, to make a claim for a\\\\r\\\\ncopyright for works that were published in electronic form, including\\\\r\\\\nsoftware, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty\\\\r\\\\npages of code--something that represented the work but did not include\\\\r\\\\nthe entire work itself and had little value to anyone.  As a temporary\\\\r\\\\nmeasure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic publications.  This measure entails a proactive role for the\\\\r\\\\nLibrary to say that it wants a particular electronic version.  Publishers\\\\r\\\\nthen have perhaps a year to submit it.  But the real problem for LC is\\\\r\\\\nwhat to do with all this material in all these different formats.  Will\\\\r\\\\nthe Library mount it?  How will it give people access to it?  How does LC\\\\r\\\\nkeep track of the appropriate computers, software, and media?  The situation\\\\r\\\\nis so hard to control, ERWAY said, that it makes sense for each publishing\\\\r\\\\nhouse to maintain its own archive.  But LC cannot enforce that either.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGIFFORD acknowledged LESK\\\\\\'s suggestion that establishing a priority\\\\r\\\\noffered the solution, albeit a fairly complicated one.  But who maintains\\\\r\\\\nthat register?, he asked.  GRABER noted that LC does attempt to collect a\\\\r\\\\nMacintosh version and the IBM-compatible version of software.  It does\\\\r\\\\nnot collect other versions.  But while true for software, BYRUM observed,\\\\r\\\\nthis reply does not speak to materials, that is, all the materials that\\\\r\\\\nwere published that were on somebody\\\\\\'s microcomputer or driver tapes\\\\r\\\\nat a publishing office across the country.  LC does well to acquire\\\\r\\\\nspecific machine-readable products selectively that were intended to be\\\\r\\\\nmachine-readable.  Materials that were in machine-readable form at one time,\\\\r\\\\nBYRUM said, would be beyond LC\\\\\\'s capability at the moment, insofar as\\\\r\\\\nattempting to acquire, organize, and preserve them are concerned--and\\\\r\\\\npreservation would be the most important consideration.  In this\\\\r\\\\nconnection, GIFFORD reiterated the need to work out some sense of\\\\r\\\\ndistributive responsibility for a number of these issues, which\\\\r\\\\ninevitably will require significant cooperation and discussion.\\\\r\\\\nNobody can do it all.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK suggested that some publishers may look with favor on LC beginning\\\\r\\\\nto serve as a depository of tapes in an electronic manuscript standard.\\\\r\\\\nPublishers may view this as a service that they did not have to perform\\\\r\\\\nand they might send in tapes.  However, SPERBERG-McQUEEN countered,\\\\r\\\\nalthough publishers have had equivalent services available to them for a\\\\r\\\\nlong time, the electronic text archive has never turned away or been\\\\r\\\\nflooded with tapes and is forever sending feedback to the depositor.\\\\r\\\\nSome publishers do send in tapes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nANDRE viewed this discussion as an allusion to the issue of standards.\\\\r\\\\nShe recommended that the AAP standard and the TEI, which has already been\\\\r\\\\nsomewhat harmonized internationally and which also shares several\\\\r\\\\ncompatibilities with the AAP, be harmonized to ensure sufficient\\\\r\\\\ncompatibility in the software.  She drew the line at saying LC ought to\\\\r\\\\nbe the locus or forum for such harmonization.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTaking the group in a slightly different direction, but one where at\\\\r\\\\nleast in the near term LC might play a helpful role, LYNCH remarked the\\\\r\\\\nplans of a number of projects to carry out preservation by creating\\\\r\\\\ndigital images that will end up in on-line or near-line storage at some\\\\r\\\\ninstitution.   Presumably, LC will link this material somehow to its\\\\r\\\\non-line catalog in most cases.  Thus, it is in a digital form.  LYNCH had\\\\r\\\\nthe impression that many of these institutions would be willing to make\\\\r\\\\nthose files accessible to other people outside the institution, provided\\\\r\\\\nthat there is no copyright problem.  This desideratum will require\\\\r\\\\npropagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they\\\\r\\\\ncan end up in other on-line catalogs.  Although uncertain about the\\\\r\\\\nmechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted\\\\r\\\\nscrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of\\\\r\\\\ncataloging and distribution of records.  It would be  foolish, given the\\\\r\\\\namount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to\\\\r\\\\ndiscover multiple institutions digitizing the same work.  Re microforms,\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH said, we are in pretty good shape.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBATTIN called this a big problem and noted that the Cornell people (who\\\\r\\\\nhad already departed) were working on it.  At issue from the beginning\\\\r\\\\nwas to learn how to catalog that information into RLIN and then into\\\\r\\\\nOCLC, so that it would be accessible.  That issue remains to be resolved.\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH rejoined that putting it into OCLC or RLIN was helpful insofar as\\\\r\\\\nsomebody who is thinking of performing preservation activity on that work\\\\r\\\\ncould learn about it.  It is not necessarily helpful for institutions to\\\\r\\\\nmake that available.  BATTIN opined that the idea was that it not only be\\\\r\\\\nfor preservation purposes but for the convenience of people looking for\\\\r\\\\nthis material.  She endorsed LYNCH\\\\\\'s dictum that duplication of this\\\\r\\\\neffort was to be avoided by every means.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY informed the Workshop about one major current activity of CETH,\\\\r\\\\nnamely a catalogue of machine-readable texts in the humanities.  Held on\\\\r\\\\nRLIN at present, the catalogue has been concentrated on ASCII as opposed\\\\r\\\\nto digitized images of text.  She is exploring ways to improve the\\\\r\\\\ncatalogue and make it more widely available, and welcomed suggestions\\\\r\\\\nabout these concerns.  CETH owns the records, which are not just\\\\r\\\\nrestricted to RLIN, and can distribute them however it wishes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTaking up LESK\\\\\\'s earlier question, BATTIN inquired whether LC, since it\\\\r\\\\nis accepting electronic files and designing a mechanism for dealing with\\\\r\\\\nthat rather than putting books on shelves, would become responsible for\\\\r\\\\nthe National Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials.  Of course\\\\r\\\\nthat could not be accomplished overnight, but it would be something LC\\\\r\\\\ncould plan for.  GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted\\\\r\\\\nto that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised\\\\r\\\\nby LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and\\\\r\\\\nHOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution.\\\\r\\\\nIt seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH\\\\\\'s original point concerning\\\\r\\\\nsome kind of directory for these kinds of materials.  In a situation\\\\r\\\\nwhere somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or\\\\r\\\\nfilm that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH\\\\r\\\\nsuggested, RLIN is helpful, but it is not helpful in the case of a local,\\\\r\\\\non-line catalogue.  Further, one would like to have her or his system be\\\\r\\\\naware that that exists in digital form, so that one can present it to a\\\\r\\\\npatron, even though one did not digitize it, if it is out of copyright.\\\\r\\\\nThe only way to make those linkages would be to perform a tremendous\\\\r\\\\namount of real-time look-up, which would be awkward at best, or\\\\r\\\\nperiodically to yank the whole file from RLIN and match it against one\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nown stuff, which is a nuisance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut where, ERWAY inquired, does one stop including things that are\\\\r\\\\navailable with Internet, for instance, in one\\\\\\'s local catalogue?\\\\r\\\\nIt almost seems that that is LC\\\\\\'s means to acquire access to them.\\\\r\\\\nThat represents LC\\\\\\'s new form of library loan.  Perhaps LC\\\\\\'s new on-line\\\\r\\\\ncatalogue is an amalgamation of all these catalogues on line.  LYNCH\\\\r\\\\nconceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term, but was not\\\\r\\\\napplicable to scanning in the short term.  In his view, the totals cited\\\\r\\\\nby Yale, 10,000 books over perhaps a four-year period, and 1,000-1,500\\\\r\\\\nbooks from Cornell, were not big numbers, while searching all over\\\\r\\\\ncreation for relatively rare occurrences will prove to be less efficient.\\\\r\\\\nAs GIFFORD wondered if this would not be a separable file on RLIN and\\\\r\\\\ncould be requested from them, BATTIN interjected that it was easily\\\\r\\\\naccessible to an institution.  SEVERTSON pointed out that that file, cum\\\\r\\\\nenhancements, was available with reference information on CD-ROM, which\\\\r\\\\nmakes it a little more available.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn HOCKEY\\\\\\'s view, the real question facing the Workshop is what to put in\\\\r\\\\nthis catalogue, because that raises the question of what constitutes a\\\\r\\\\npublication in the electronic world.  (WEIBEL interjected that Eric Joule\\\\r\\\\nin OCLC\\\\\\'s Office of Research is also wrestling with this particular\\\\r\\\\nproblem, while GIFFORD thought it sounded fairly generic.)  HOCKEY\\\\r\\\\ncontended that a majority of texts in the humanities are in the hands\\\\r\\\\nof either a small number of large research institutions or individuals\\\\r\\\\nand are not generally available for anyone else to access at all.\\\\r\\\\nShe wondered if these texts ought to be catalogued.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter argument proceeded back and forth for several minutes over why\\\\r\\\\ncataloguing might be a necessary service, LEBRON suggested that this\\\\r\\\\nissue involved the responsibility of a publisher.  The fact that someone\\\\r\\\\nhas created something electronically and keeps it under his or her\\\\r\\\\ncontrol does not constitute publication.  Publication implies\\\\r\\\\ndissemination.  While it would be important for a scholar to let other\\\\r\\\\npeople know that this creation exists, in many respects this is no\\\\r\\\\ndifferent from an unpublished manuscript.  That is what is being accessed\\\\r\\\\nin there, except that now one is not looking at it in the hard-copy but\\\\r\\\\nin the electronic environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLEBRON expressed puzzlement at the variety of ways electronic publishing\\\\r\\\\nhas been viewed.  Much of what has been discussed throughout these two\\\\r\\\\ndays has concerned CD-ROM publishing, whereas in the on-line environment\\\\r\\\\nthat she confronts, the constraints and challenges are very different.\\\\r\\\\nSooner or later LC will have to deal with the concept of on-line\\\\r\\\\npublishing.  Taking up the comment ERWAY made earlier about storing\\\\r\\\\ncopies, LEBRON gave her own journal as an example.  How would she deposit\\\\r\\\\nOJCCT for copyright?, she asked, because the journal will exist in the\\\\r\\\\nmainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it.  Here the\\\\r\\\\nsituation is different, ownership versus access, and is something that\\\\r\\\\narises with publication in the on-line environment, faster than is\\\\r\\\\nsometimes realized.  Lacking clear answers to all of these questions\\\\r\\\\nherself, LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role\\\\r\\\\nin helping to define some of them for quite a while.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGREENFIELD observed that LC\\\\\\'s Network Development Office is attempting,\\\\r\\\\namong other things, to explore the limits of MARC as a standard in terms\\\\r\\\\nof handling electronic information.  GREENFIELD also noted that Rebecca\\\\r\\\\nGUENTHER from that office gave a paper to the American Society for\\\\r\\\\nInformation Science (ASIS) summarizing several of the discussion papers\\\\r\\\\nthat were coming out of the Network Development Office.  GREENFIELD said\\\\r\\\\nhe understood that that office had a list-server soliciting just the kind\\\\r\\\\nof feedback received today concerning the difficulties of identifying and\\\\r\\\\ncataloguing electronic information.  GREENFIELD hoped that everybody\\\\r\\\\nwould be aware of that and somehow contribute to that conversation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNoting two of LC\\\\\\'s roles, first, to act as a repository of record for\\\\r\\\\nmaterial that is copyrighted in this country, and second, to make\\\\r\\\\nmaterials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that\\\\r\\\\ngoes beyond Congress, BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to\\\\r\\\\nextend those responsibilities to all the things being published in\\\\r\\\\nelectronic form.  This would mean eventually accepting electronic\\\\r\\\\nformats.  LC could require that at some point they be in a certain\\\\r\\\\nlimited set of formats, and then develop mechanisms for allowing people\\\\r\\\\nto access those in the same way that other things are accessed.  This\\\\r\\\\ndoes not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone.\\\\r\\\\nLC does that with most of its bibliographic records, BESSER said, which\\\\r\\\\nend up migrating to the utility (e.g., OCLC) or somewhere else.  But just\\\\r\\\\nas most of LC\\\\\\'s books are available in some form through interlibrary\\\\r\\\\nloan or some other mechanism, so in the same way electronic formats ought\\\\r\\\\nto be available to others in some format, though with some copyright\\\\r\\\\nconsiderations.  BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be\\\\r\\\\nestablished tomorrow, only that they seemed to fall within LC\\\\\\'s purview,\\\\r\\\\nand that there should be long-range plans to establish them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAcknowledging that those from LC in the room agreed with BESSER\\\\r\\\\nconcerning the need to confront difficult questions, GIFFORD underscored\\\\r\\\\nthe magnitude of the problem of what to keep and what to select.  GIFFORD\\\\r\\\\nnoted that LC currently receives some 31,000 items per day, not counting\\\\r\\\\nelectronic materials, and argued for much more distributed responsibility\\\\r\\\\nin order to maintain and store electronic information.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBESSER responded that the assembled group could be viewed as a starting\\\\r\\\\npoint, whose initial operating premise could be helping to move in this\\\\r\\\\ndirection and defining how LC could do so, for example, in areas of\\\\r\\\\nstandardization or distribution of responsibility.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER added that AM was fully engaged, wrestling with some of the\\\\r\\\\nquestions that pertain to the conversion of older historical materials,\\\\r\\\\nwhich would be one thing that the Library of Congress might do.  Several\\\\r\\\\npoints mentioned by BESSER and several others on this question have a\\\\r\\\\nmuch greater impact on those who are concerned with cataloguing and the\\\\r\\\\nnetworking of bibliographic information, as well as preservation itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpeaking directly to AM, which he considered was a largely uncopyrighted\\\\r\\\\ndatabase, LYNCH urged development of a network version of AM, or\\\\r\\\\nconsideration of making the data in it available to people interested in\\\\r\\\\ndoing network multimedia.  On account of the current great shortage of\\\\r\\\\ndigital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights\\\\r\\\\nproblems, this course of action could have a significant effect on making\\\\r\\\\nnetwork multimedia a reality.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn this connection, FLEISCHHAUER reported on a fragmentary prototype in\\\\r\\\\nLC\\\\\\'s Office of Information Technology Services that attempts to associate\\\\r\\\\ndigital images of photographs with cataloguing information in ways that\\\\r\\\\nwork within a local area network--a step, so to say, toward AM\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nconstruction of some sort of apparatus for access.  Further, AM has\\\\r\\\\nattempted to use standard data forms in order to help make that\\\\r\\\\ndistinction between the access tools and the underlying data, and thus\\\\r\\\\nbelieves that the database is networkable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA delicate and agonizing policy question for LC, however, which comes\\\\r\\\\nback to resources and unfortunately has an impact on this, is to find\\\\r\\\\nsome appropriate, honorable, and legal cost-recovery possibilities.  A\\\\r\\\\ncertain skittishness concerning cost-recovery has made people unsure\\\\r\\\\nexactly what to do.  AM would be highly receptive to discussing further\\\\r\\\\nLYNCH\\\\\\'s offer to test or demonstrate its database in a network\\\\r\\\\nenvironment, FLEISCHHAUER said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nReturning the discussion to what she viewed as the vital issue of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic deposit, BATTIN recommended that LC initiate a catalytic\\\\r\\\\nprocess in terms of distributed responsibility, that is, bring together\\\\r\\\\nthe distributed organizations and set up a study group to look at all\\\\r\\\\nthese issues and see where we as a nation should move.  The broader\\\\r\\\\nissues of how we deal with the management of electronic information will\\\\r\\\\nnot disappear, but only grow worse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLESK took up this theme and suggested that LC attempt to persuade one\\\\r\\\\nmajor library in each state to deal with its state equivalent publisher,\\\\r\\\\nwhich might produce a cooperative project that would be equitably\\\\r\\\\ndistributed around the country, and one in which LC would be dealing with\\\\r\\\\na minimal number of publishers and minimal copyright problems.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGRABER remarked the recent development in the scientific community of a\\\\r\\\\nwillingness to use SGML and either deposit or interchange on a fairly\\\\r\\\\nstandardized format.  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place\\\\r\\\\nin the humanities.  Although the National Library of Medicine found only\\\\r\\\\na few publishers to cooperate in a like venture two or three years ago, a\\\\r\\\\nnew effort might generate a much larger number willing to cooperate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKIMBALL recounted his unit\\\\\\'s (Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room)\\\\r\\\\ntroubles with the commercial publishers of electronic media in acquiring\\\\r\\\\nmaterials for LC\\\\\\'s collections, in particular the publishers\\\\\\' fear that\\\\r\\\\nthey would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of\\\\r\\\\ntheir products, that LC would give them away or sell them and make\\\\r\\\\nprofits from them.  He doubted that the publishing industry was prepared\\\\r\\\\nto move into this area at the moment, given its resistance to allowing LC\\\\r\\\\nto use its machine-readable materials as the Library would like.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium, and LC can\\\\r\\\\nrequest one copy of that, or two copies if it is the only version, and\\\\r\\\\ncan request copies of software, but that fails to address magazines or\\\\r\\\\nbooks or anything like that which is in machine-readable form.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue, which he illustrated\\\\r\\\\nwith the example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a copy of a\\\\r\\\\nscientific database on a LAN in LC\\\\\\'s science reading room.  He also\\\\r\\\\nacknowledged that LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents\\\\r\\\\nof Workshop participants in thinking through a number of these problems.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGIFFORD returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to\\\\r\\\\nthink through together where they want to go in the long term.  MYLONAS\\\\r\\\\nconceded that her experience at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at\\\\r\\\\nGeorgetown University and this week at LC had forced her to reevaluate\\\\r\\\\nher perspective on the usefulness of text as images.  MYLONAS framed the\\\\r\\\\nissues in a series of questions:  How do we acquire machine-readable\\\\r\\\\ntext?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it\\\\r\\\\nimportant to obtain very high-quality images and text, etc.?\\\\r\\\\nFLEISCHHAUER agreed with MYLONAS\\\\\\'s framing of strategic questions, adding\\\\r\\\\nthat a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those\\\\r\\\\nthings at different times.  Thus, the trick is to exercise judgment.  The\\\\r\\\\nWorkshop had added to his and AM\\\\\\'s considerations in making those\\\\r\\\\njudgments.  Concerning future meetings or discussions, MYLONAS suggested\\\\r\\\\nthat screening priorities would be helpful.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWEIBEL opined that the diversity reflected in this group was a sign both\\\\r\\\\nof the health and of the immaturity of the field, and more time would\\\\r\\\\nhave to pass before we convince one another concerning standards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the\\\\r\\\\ndriving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was\\\\r\\\\nthe preservation of knowledge for the future, not simply for particular\\\\r\\\\nresearch use.  In the case of Perseus, MYLONAS said, the assumption was\\\\r\\\\nthat the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable\\\\r\\\\nform.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an\\\\r\\\\narchival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of, say, the Bill\\\\r\\\\nof Rights, in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the\\\\r\\\\narchival copies for the Cornell mathematics books.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n               ***   ***   ***   ******   ***   ***   ***\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                          Appendix I:  PROGRAM\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                                WORKSHOP\\\\r\\\\n                                   ON\\\\r\\\\n                               ELECTRONIC\\\\r\\\\n                                  TEXTS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                             9-10 June 1992\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n                           Library of Congress\\\\r\\\\n                            Washington, D.C.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n    Supported by a Grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTuesday, 9 June 1992\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNATIONAL DEMONSTRATION LAB, ATRIUM, LIBRARY MADISON\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n8:30 AM   Coffee and Danish, registration\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n9:00 AM   Welcome\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          Prosser Gifford, Director for Scholarly Programs, and Carl\\\\r\\\\n             Fleischhauer, Coordinator, American Memory, Library of\\\\r\\\\n             Congress\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n9:l5 AM   Session I.

Many of the\\\\r\\\\nremarks are drawn from a report the speaker coauthored with Jeff\\\\r\\\\nRothenberg, a computer scientist at The RAND Corporation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe speaker assesses 1) current scholarly use of information technology\\\\r\\\\nand 2) the key trends in information technology most relevant to the\\\\r\\\\nresearch process, in order to predict how social sciences and humanities\\\\r\\\\nscholars are apt to use electronic texts.  In introducing the topic,\\\\r\\\\ncurrent use of electronic texts is explored broadly within the context of\\\\r\\\\nscholarly communication.  From the perspective of scholarly\\\\r\\\\ncommunication, the work of humanities and social sciences scholars\\\\r\\\\ninvolves five processes:  1) identification of sources, 2) communication\\\\r\\\\nwith colleagues, 3) interpretation and analysis of data, 4) dissemination\\\\r\\\\nof research findings, and 5) curriculum development and instruction.  The\\\\r\\\\nextent to which computation currently permeates aspects of scholarly\\\\r\\\\ncommunication represents a viable indicator of the prospects for\\\\r\\\\nelectronic texts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe discussion of current practice is balanced by an analysis of key\\\\r\\\\ntrends in the scholarly use of information technology.  These include the\\\\r\\\\ntrends toward end-user computing and connectivity, which provide a\\\\r\\\\nframework for forecasting the use of electronic texts through this\\\\r\\\\nmillennium.  The presentation concludes with a summary of the ways in\\\\r\\\\nwhich the nonscientific scholarly community can be expected to use\\\\r\\\\nelectronic texts, and the implications of that use for information\\\\r\\\\nproviders.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSusan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN    Electronic Archives for the Public:\\\\r\\\\n                                   Use of American Memory in Public and\\\\r\\\\n                                   School Libraries\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis joint discussion focuses on nonscholarly applications of electronic\\\\r\\\\nlibrary materials, specifically addressing use of the Library of Congress\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Memory (AM) program in a small number of public and school\\\\r\\\\nlibraries throughout the United States.  AM consists of selected Library\\\\r\\\\nof Congress primary archival materials, stored on optical media\\\\r\\\\n(CD-ROM/videodisc), and presented with little or no editing.  Many\\\\r\\\\ncollections are accompanied by electronic introductions and user\\\\\\'s guides\\\\r\\\\noffering background information and historical context.  Collections\\\\r\\\\nrepresent a variety of formats including photographs, graphic arts,\\\\r\\\\nmotion pictures, recorded sound, music, broadsides and manuscripts,\\\\r\\\\nbooks, and pamphlets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn 1991, the Library of Congress began a nationwide evaluation of AM in\\\\r\\\\ndifferent types of institutions.  Test sites include public libraries,\\\\r\\\\nelementary and secondary school libraries, college and university\\\\r\\\\nlibraries, state libraries, and special libraries.  Susan VECCIA and\\\\r\\\\nJoanne FREEMAN will discuss their observations on the use of AM by the\\\\r\\\\nnonscholarly community, using evidence gleaned from this ongoing\\\\r\\\\nevaluation effort.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVECCIA will comment on the overall goals of the evaluation project, and\\\\r\\\\nthe types of public and school libraries included in this study.  Her\\\\r\\\\ncomments on nonscholarly use of AM will focus on the public library as a\\\\r\\\\ncultural and community institution, often bridging the gap between formal\\\\r\\\\nand informal education.  FREEMAN will discuss the use of AM in school\\\\r\\\\nlibraries.  Use by students and teachers has revealed some broad\\\\r\\\\nquestions about the use of electronic resources, as well as definite\\\\r\\\\nbenefits gained by the \"nonscholar.\"  Topics will include the problem of\\\\r\\\\ngrasping content and context in an electronic environment, the stumbling\\\\r\\\\nblocks created by \"new\" technologies, and the unique skills and interests\\\\r\\\\nawakened through use of electronic resources.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION II\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nElli MYLONAS             The Perseus Project:  Interactive Sources and\\\\r\\\\n                         Studies in Classical Greece\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Perseus Project (5) has just released Perseus 1.0, the first publicly\\\\r\\\\navailable version of its hypertextual database of multimedia materials on\\\\r\\\\nclassical Greece.  Perseus is designed to be used by a wide audience,\\\\r\\\\ncomprised of readers at the student and scholar levels.  As such, it must\\\\r\\\\nbe able to locate information using different strategies, and it must\\\\r\\\\ncontain enough detail to serve the different needs of its users.  In\\\\r\\\\naddition, it must be delivered so that it is affordable to its target\\\\r\\\\naudience.  [These problems and the solutions we chose are described in\\\\r\\\\nMylonas, \"An Interface to Classical Greek Civilization,\" JASIS 43:2,\\\\r\\\\nMarch 1992.]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn order to achieve its objective, the project staff decided to make a\\\\r\\\\nconscious separation between selecting and converting textual, database,\\\\r\\\\nand image data on the one hand, and putting it into a delivery system on\\\\r\\\\nthe other.  That way, it is possible to create the electronic data\\\\r\\\\nwithout thinking about the restrictions of the delivery system.  We have\\\\r\\\\nmade a great effort to choose system-independent formats for our data,\\\\r\\\\nand to put as much thought and work as possible into structuring it so\\\\r\\\\nthat the translation from paper to electronic form will enhance the value\\\\r\\\\nof the data. [A discussion of these solutions as of two years ago is in\\\\r\\\\nElli Mylonas, Gregory Crane, Kenneth Morrell, and D. Neel Smith, \"The\\\\r\\\\nPerseus Project:  Data in the Electronic Age,\" in Accessing Antiquity:\\\\r\\\\nThe Computerization of Classical Databases, J. Solomon and T. Worthen\\\\r\\\\n(eds.),  University of Arizona Press, in press.]\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMuch of the work on Perseus is focused on collecting and converting the\\\\r\\\\ndata on which the project is based.  At the same time, it is necessary to\\\\r\\\\nprovide means of access to the information, in order to make it usable,\\\\r\\\\nand them to investigate how it is used.  As we learn more about what\\\\r\\\\nstudents and scholars from different backgrounds do with Perseus, we can\\\\r\\\\nadjust our data collection, and also modify the system to accommodate\\\\r\\\\nthem.  In creating a delivery system for general use, we have tried to\\\\r\\\\navoid favoring any one type of use by allowing multiple forms of access\\\\r\\\\nto and navigation through the system.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe way text is handled exemplifies some of these principles.  All text\\\\r\\\\nin Perseus is tagged using SGML, following the guidelines of the Text\\\\r\\\\nEncoding Initiative (TEI).  This markup is used to index the text, and\\\\r\\\\nprocess it so that it can be imported into HyperCard.  No SGML markup\\\\r\\\\nremains in the text that reaches the user, because currently it would be\\\\r\\\\ntoo expensive to create a system that acts on SGML in real time.\\\\r\\\\nHowever, the regularity provided by SGML is essential for verifying the\\\\r\\\\ncontent of the texts, and greatly speeds all the processing performed on\\\\r\\\\nthem.  The fact that the texts exist in SGML ensures that they will be\\\\r\\\\nrelatively easy to port to different hardware and software, and so will\\\\r\\\\noutlast the current delivery platform.  Finally, the SGML markup\\\\r\\\\nincorporates existing canonical reference systems (chapter, verse, line,\\\\r\\\\netc.); indexing and navigation are based on these features.  This ensures\\\\r\\\\nthat the same canonical reference will always resolve to the same point\\\\r\\\\nwithin a text, and that all versions of our texts, regardless of delivery\\\\r\\\\nplatform (even paper printouts) will function the same way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn order to provide tools for users, the text is processed by a\\\\r\\\\nmorphological analyzer, and the results are stored in a database.\\\\r\\\\nTogether with the index, the Greek-English Lexicon, and the index of all\\\\r\\\\nthe English words in the definitions of the lexicon, the morphological\\\\r\\\\nanalyses comprise a set of linguistic tools that allow users of all\\\\r\\\\nlevels to work with the textual information, and to accomplish different\\\\r\\\\ntasks.  For example, students who read no Greek may explore a concept as\\\\r\\\\nit appears in Greek texts by using the English-Greek index, and then\\\\r\\\\nlooking up works in the texts and translations, or scholars may do\\\\r\\\\ndetailed morphological studies of word use by using the morphological\\\\r\\\\nanalyses of the texts.  Because these tools were not designed for any one\\\\r\\\\nuse, the same tools and the same data can be used by both students and\\\\r\\\\nscholars.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNOTES:\\\\r\\\\n     (5)  Perseus is based at Harvard University, with collaborators at\\\\r\\\\n     several other universities.

It is published by Yale University\\\\r\\\\n     Press.  Perseus runs on Macintosh computers, under the HyperCard\\\\r\\\\n     program.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEric CALALUCA\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChadwyck-Healey embarked last year on two distinct yet related full-text\\\\r\\\\nhumanities database projects.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe English Poetry Full-Text Database and the Patrologia Latina Database\\\\r\\\\nrepresent new approaches to linguistic research resources.  The size and\\\\r\\\\ncomplexity of the projects present problems for electronic publishers,\\\\r\\\\nbut surmountable ones if they remain abreast of the latest possibilities\\\\r\\\\nin data capture and retrieval software techniques.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe issues which required address prior to the commencement of the\\\\r\\\\nprojects were legion:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     1.   Editorial selection (or exclusion) of materials in each\\\\r\\\\n          database\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     2.   Deciding whether or not to incorporate a normative encoding\\\\r\\\\n          structure into the databases?\\\\r\\\\n               A.  If one is selected, should it be SGML?\\\\r\\\\n               B.  If SGML, then the TEI?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     3.   Deliver as CD-ROM, magnetic tape, or both?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     4.   Can one produce retrieval software advanced enough for the\\\\r\\\\n          postdoctoral linguist, yet accessible enough for unattended\\\\r\\\\n          general use?  Should one try?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     5.   Re fair and liberal networking policies, what are the risks to\\\\r\\\\n          an electronic publisher?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     6.   How does the emergence of national and international education\\\\r\\\\n          networks affect the use and viability of research projects\\\\r\\\\n          requiring high investment?  Do the new European Community\\\\r\\\\n          directives concerning database protection necessitate two\\\\r\\\\n          distinct publishing projects, one for North America and one for\\\\r\\\\n          overseas?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom new notions of \"scholarly fair use\" to the future of optical media,\\\\r\\\\nvirtually every issue related to electronic publishing was aired.  The\\\\r\\\\nresult is two projects which have been constructed to provide the quality\\\\r\\\\nresearch resources with the fewest encumbrances to use by teachers and\\\\r\\\\nprivate scholars.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDorothy TWOHIG\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn spring 1988 the editors of the papers of George Washington, John\\\\r\\\\nAdams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin were\\\\r\\\\napproached by classics scholar David Packard on behalf of the Packard\\\\r\\\\nHumanities Foundation with a proposal to produce a CD-ROM edition of the\\\\r\\\\ncomplete papers of each of the Founding Fathers.  This electronic edition\\\\r\\\\nwill supplement the published volumes, making the documents widely\\\\r\\\\navailable to students and researchers at reasonable cost.  We estimate\\\\r\\\\nthat our CD-ROM edition of Washington\\\\\\'s Papers will be substantially\\\\r\\\\ncompleted within the next two years and ready for publication.  Within\\\\r\\\\nthe next ten years or so, similar CD-ROM editions of the Franklin, Adams,\\\\r\\\\nJefferson, and Madison papers also will be available.  At the Library of\\\\r\\\\nCongress\\\\\\'s session on technology, I would like to discuss not only the\\\\r\\\\nexperience of the Washington Papers in producing the CD-ROM edition, but\\\\r\\\\nthe impact technology has had on these major editorial projects.\\\\r\\\\nAlready, we are editing our volumes with an eye to the material that will\\\\r\\\\nbe readily available in the CD-ROM edition.  The completed electronic\\\\r\\\\nedition will provide immense possibilities for the searching of documents\\\\r\\\\nfor information in a way never possible before.  The kind of technical\\\\r\\\\ninnovations that are currently available and on the drawing board will\\\\r\\\\nsoon revolutionize historical research and the production of historical\\\\r\\\\ndocuments.  Unfortunately, much of this new technology is not being used\\\\r\\\\nin the planning stages of historical projects, simply because many\\\\r\\\\nhistorians are aware only in the vaguest way of its existence.  At least\\\\r\\\\ntwo major new historical editing projects are considering microfilm\\\\r\\\\neditions, simply because they are not aware of the possibilities of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic alternatives and the advantages of the new technology in terms\\\\r\\\\nof flexibility and research potential compared to microfilm.  In fact,\\\\r\\\\ntoo many of us in history and literature are still at the stage of\\\\r\\\\nstruggling with our PCs.  There are many historical editorial projects in\\\\r\\\\nprogress presently, and an equal number of literary projects.  While the\\\\r\\\\ntwo fields have somewhat different approaches to textual editing, there\\\\r\\\\nare ways in which electronic technology can be of service to both.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSince few of the editors involved in the Founding Fathers CD-ROM editions\\\\r\\\\nare technical experts in any sense, I hope to point out in my discussion\\\\r\\\\nof our experience how many of these electronic innovations can be used\\\\r\\\\nsuccessfully by scholars who are novices in the world of new technology.\\\\r\\\\nOne of the major concerns of the sponsors of the multitude of new\\\\r\\\\nscholarly editions is the limited audience reached by the published\\\\r\\\\nvolumes.  Most of these editions are being published in small quantities\\\\r\\\\nand the publishers\\\\\\' price for them puts them out of the reach not only of\\\\r\\\\nindividual scholars but of most public libraries and all but the largest\\\\r\\\\neducational institutions.  However, little attention is being given to\\\\r\\\\nways in which technology can bypass conventional publication to make\\\\r\\\\nhistorical and literary documents more widely available.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat attracted us most to the CD-ROM edition of The Papers of George\\\\r\\\\nWashington was the fact that David Packard\\\\\\'s aim was to make a complete\\\\r\\\\nedition of all of the 135,000 documents we have collected available in an\\\\r\\\\ninexpensive format that would be placed in public libraries, small\\\\r\\\\ncolleges, and even high schools.  This would provide an audience far\\\\r\\\\nbeyond our present 1,000-copy, $45 published edition.  Since the CD-ROM\\\\r\\\\nedition will carry none of the explanatory annotation that appears in the\\\\r\\\\npublished volumes, we also feel that the use of the CD-ROM will lead many\\\\r\\\\nresearchers to seek out the published volumes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn addition to ignorance of new technical advances, I have found that too\\\\r\\\\nmany editors--and historians and literary scholars--are resistant and\\\\r\\\\neven hostile to suggestions that electronic technology may enhance their\\\\r\\\\nwork.  I intend to discuss some of the arguments traditionalists are\\\\r\\\\nadvancing to resist technology, ranging from distrust of the speed with\\\\r\\\\nwhich it changes (we are already wondering what is out there that is\\\\r\\\\nbetter than CD-ROM) to suspicion of the technical language used to\\\\r\\\\ndescribe electronic developments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMaria LEBRON\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials, a joint venture of the\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Online\\\\r\\\\nComputer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC), is the first peer-reviewed journal\\\\r\\\\nto provide full text, tabular material, and line illustrations on line.\\\\r\\\\nThis presentation will discuss the genesis and start-up period of the\\\\r\\\\njournal.  Topics of discussion will include historical overview,\\\\r\\\\nday-to-day management of the editorial peer review, and manuscript\\\\r\\\\ntagging and publication.  A demonstration of the journal and its features\\\\r\\\\nwill accompany the presentation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLynne PERSONIUS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCornell University Library, Cornell Information Technologies, and Xerox\\\\r\\\\nCorporation, with the support of the Commission on Preservation and\\\\r\\\\nAccess, and Sun Microsystems, Inc., have been collaborating in a project\\\\r\\\\nto test a prototype system for recording brittle books as digital images\\\\r\\\\nand producing, on demand, high-quality archival paper replacements.  The\\\\r\\\\nproject goes beyond that, however, to investigate some of the issues\\\\r\\\\nsurrounding scanning, storing, retrieving, and providing access to\\\\r\\\\ndigital images in a network environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Joint Study in Digital Preservation began in January 1990.  Xerox\\\\r\\\\nprovided the College Library Access and Storage System (CLASS) software,\\\\r\\\\na prototype 600-dots-per-inch (dpi) scanner, and the hardware necessary\\\\r\\\\nto support network printing on the DocuTech printer housed in Cornell\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nComputing and Communications Center (CCC).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Cornell staff using the hardware and software became an integral part\\\\r\\\\nof the development and testing process for enhancements to the CLASS\\\\r\\\\nsoftware system.  The collaborative nature of this relationship is\\\\r\\\\nresulting in a system that is specifically tailored to the preservation\\\\r\\\\napplication.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA digital library of 1,000 volumes (or approximately 300,000 images) has\\\\r\\\\nbeen created and is stored on an optical jukebox that resides in CCC.\\\\r\\\\nThe library includes a collection of select mathematics monographs that\\\\r\\\\nprovides mathematics faculty with an opportunity to use the electronic\\\\r\\\\nlibrary.  The remaining volumes were chosen for the library to test the\\\\r\\\\nvarious capabilities of the scanning system.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne project objective is to provide users of the Cornell library and the\\\\r\\\\nlibrary staff with the ability to request facsimiles of digitized images\\\\r\\\\nor to retrieve the actual electronic image for browsing.  A prototype\\\\r\\\\nviewing workstation has been created by Xerox, with input into the design\\\\r\\\\nby a committee of Cornell librarians and computer professionals.  This\\\\r\\\\nwill allow us to experiment with patron access to the images that make up\\\\r\\\\nthe digital library.  The viewing station provides search, retrieval, and\\\\r\\\\n(ultimately) printing functions with enhancements to facilitate\\\\r\\\\nnavigation through multiple documents.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCornell currently is working to extend access to the digital library to\\\\r\\\\nreaders using workstations from their offices.  This year is devoted to\\\\r\\\\nthe development of a network resident image conversion and delivery\\\\r\\\\nserver, and client software that will support readers who use Apple\\\\r\\\\nMacintosh computers, IBM windows platforms, and Sun workstations.\\\\r\\\\nEquipment for this development was provided by Sun Microsystems with\\\\r\\\\nsupport from the Commission on Preservation and Access.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring the show-and-tell session of the Workshop on Electronic Texts, a\\\\r\\\\nprototype view station will be demonstrated.  In addition, a display of\\\\r\\\\noriginal library books that have been digitized will be available for\\\\r\\\\nreview with associated printed copies for comparison.  The fifteen-minute\\\\r\\\\noverview of the project will include a slide presentation that\\\\r\\\\nconstitutes a \"tour\" of the preservation digitizing process.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe final network-connected version of the viewing station will provide\\\\r\\\\nlibrary users with another mechanism for accessing the digital library,\\\\r\\\\nand will also provide the capability of viewing images directly.  This\\\\r\\\\nwill not require special software, although a powerful computer with good\\\\r\\\\ngraphics will be needed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Joint Study in Digital Preservation has generated a great deal of\\\\r\\\\ninterest in the library community.  Unfortunately, or perhaps\\\\r\\\\nfortunately, this project serves to raise a vast number of other issues\\\\r\\\\nsurrounding the use of digital technology for the preservation and use of\\\\r\\\\ndeteriorating library materials, which subsequent projects will need to\\\\r\\\\nexamine.  Much work remains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION III\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHoward BESSER                      Networking Multimedia Databases\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat do we have to consider in building and distributing databases of\\\\r\\\\nvisual materials in a multi-user environment?  This presentation examines\\\\r\\\\na variety of concerns that need to be addressed before a multimedia\\\\r\\\\ndatabase can be set up in a networked environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the past it has not been feasible to implement databases of visual\\\\r\\\\nmaterials in shared-user environments because of technological barriers.\\\\r\\\\nEach of the two basic models for multi-user multimedia databases has\\\\r\\\\nposed its own problem.  The analog multimedia storage model (represented\\\\r\\\\nby Project Athena\\\\\\'s parallel analog and digital networks) has required an\\\\r\\\\nincredibly complex (and expensive) infrastructure.  The economies of\\\\r\\\\nscale that make multi-user setups cheaper per user served do not operate\\\\r\\\\nin an environment that requires a computer workstation, videodisc player,\\\\r\\\\nand two display devices for each user.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe digital multimedia storage model has required vast amounts of storage\\\\r\\\\nspace (as much as one gigabyte per thirty still images).  In the past the\\\\r\\\\ncost of such a large amount of storage space made this model a\\\\r\\\\nprohibitive choice as well.  But plunging storage costs are finally\\\\r\\\\nmaking this second alternative viable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf storage no longer poses such an impediment, what do we need to\\\\r\\\\nconsider in building digitally stored multi-user databases of visual\\\\r\\\\nmaterials?  This presentation will examine the networking and\\\\r\\\\ntelecommunication constraints that must be overcome before such databases\\\\r\\\\ncan become commonplace and useful to a large number of people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe key problem is the vast size of multimedia documents, and how this\\\\r\\\\naffects not only storage but telecommunications transmission time.\\\\r\\\\nAnything slower than T-1 speed is impractical for files of 1 megabyte or\\\\r\\\\nlarger (which is likely to be small for a multimedia document).  For\\\\r\\\\ninstance, even on a 56 Kb line it would take three minutes to transfer a\\\\r\\\\n1-megabyte file.  And these figures assume ideal circumstances, and do\\\\r\\\\nnot take into consideration other users contending for network bandwidth,\\\\r\\\\ndisk access time, or the time needed for remote display.  Current common\\\\r\\\\ntelephone transmission rates would be completely impractical; few users\\\\r\\\\nwould be willing to wait the hour necessary to transmit a single image at\\\\r\\\\n2400 baud.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis necessitates compression, which itself raises a number of other\\\\r\\\\nissues.  In order to decrease file sizes significantly, we must employ\\\\r\\\\nlossy compression algorithms.  But how much quality can we afford to\\\\r\\\\nlose?  To date there has been only one significant study done of\\\\r\\\\nimage-quality needs for a particular user group, and this study did not\\\\r\\\\nlook at loss resulting from compression.  Only after identifying\\\\r\\\\nimage-quality needs can we begin to address storage and network bandwidth\\\\r\\\\nneeds.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nExperience with X-Windows-based applications (such as Imagequery, the\\\\r\\\\nUniversity of California at Berkeley image database) demonstrates the\\\\r\\\\nutility of a client-server topology, but also points to the limitation of\\\\r\\\\ncurrent software for a distributed environment.  For example,\\\\r\\\\napplications like Imagequery can incorporate compression, but current X\\\\r\\\\nimplementations do not permit decompression at the end user\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nworkstation.  Such decompression at the host computer alleviates storage\\\\r\\\\ncapacity problems while doing nothing to address problems of\\\\r\\\\ntelecommunications bandwidth.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe need to examine the effects on network through-put of moving\\\\r\\\\nmultimedia documents around on a network.  We need to examine various\\\\r\\\\ntopologies that will help us avoid bottlenecks around servers and\\\\r\\\\ngateways.  Experience with applications such as these raise still broader\\\\r\\\\nquestions. How closely is the multimedia document tied to the software\\\\r\\\\nfor viewing it?  Can it be accessed and viewed from other applications?\\\\r\\\\nExperience with the MARC format (and more recently with the Z39.50\\\\r\\\\nprotocols) shows how useful it can be to store documents in a form in\\\\r\\\\nwhich they can be accessed by a variety of application software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally, from an intellectual-access standpoint, we need to address the\\\\r\\\\nissue of providing access to these multimedia documents in\\\\r\\\\ninterdisciplinary environments.  We need to examine terminology and\\\\r\\\\nindexing strategies that will allow us to provide access to this material\\\\r\\\\nin a cross-disciplinary way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRonald LARSEN            Directions in High-Performance Networking for\\\\r\\\\n                         Libraries\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe pace at which computing technology has advanced over the past forty\\\\r\\\\nyears shows no sign of abating.  Roughly speaking, each five-year period\\\\r\\\\nhas yielded an order-of-magnitude improvement in price and performance of\\\\r\\\\ncomputing equipment.  No fundamental hurdles are likely to prevent this\\\\r\\\\npace from continuing for at least the next decade.  It is only in the\\\\r\\\\npast five years, though, that computing has become ubiquitous in\\\\r\\\\nlibraries, affecting all staff and patrons, directly or indirectly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDuring these same five years, communications rates on the Internet, the\\\\r\\\\nprincipal academic computing network, have grown from 56 kbps to 1.5\\\\r\\\\nMbps, and the NSFNet backbone is now running 45 Mbps.  Over the next five\\\\r\\\\nyears, communication rates on the backbone are expected to exceed 1 Gbps.\\\\r\\\\nGrowth in both the population of network users and the volume of network\\\\r\\\\ntraffic  has continued to grow geometrically, at rates approaching 15\\\\r\\\\npercent per month.  This flood of capacity and use, likened by some to\\\\r\\\\n\"drinking from a firehose,\"  creates immense opportunities and challenges\\\\r\\\\nfor libraries.  Libraries must anticipate the future implications of this\\\\r\\\\ntechnology, participate in its development, and deploy it to ensure\\\\r\\\\naccess to the world\\\\\\'s information resources.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe infrastructure for the information age is being put in place.\\\\r\\\\nLibraries face strategic decisions about their role in the development,\\\\r\\\\ndeployment, and use of this infrastructure.  The emerging infrastructure\\\\r\\\\nis much more than computers and communication lines.  It is more than the\\\\r\\\\nability to compute at a remote site, send electronic mail to a peer\\\\r\\\\nacross the country, or move a file from one library to another.  The next\\\\r\\\\nfive years will witness substantial development of the information\\\\r\\\\ninfrastructure of the network.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn order to provide appropriate leadership, library professionals must\\\\r\\\\nhave a fundamental understanding of and appreciation for computer\\\\r\\\\nnetworking, from local area networks to the National Research and\\\\r\\\\nEducation Network (NREN).  This presentation addresses these\\\\r\\\\nfundamentals, and how they relate to libraries today and in the near\\\\r\\\\nfuture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEdwin BROWNRIGG               Electronic Library Visions and Realities\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe electronic library has been a vision desired by many--and rejected by\\\\r\\\\nsome--since Vannevar Bush coined the term memex to describe an automated,\\\\r\\\\nintelligent, personal information system.  Variations on this vision have\\\\r\\\\nincluded Ted Nelson\\\\\\'s Xanadau, Alan Kay\\\\\\'s Dynabook, and Lancaster\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\n\"paperless library,\" with the most recent incarnation being the\\\\r\\\\n\"Knowledge Navigator\" described by John Scully of Apple.  But the reality\\\\r\\\\nof library service has been less visionary and the leap to the electronic\\\\r\\\\nlibrary has eluded universities, publishers, and information technology\\\\r\\\\nfiles.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Memex Research Institute (MemRI), an independent, nonprofit research\\\\r\\\\nand development organization, has created an Electronic Library Program\\\\r\\\\nof shared research and development in order to make the collective vision\\\\r\\\\nmore concrete.  The program is working toward the creation of large,\\\\r\\\\nindexed publicly available electronic image collections of published\\\\r\\\\ndocuments in academic, special, and public libraries.  This strategic\\\\r\\\\nplan is the result of the first stage of the program, which has been an\\\\r\\\\ninvestigation of the information technologies available to support such\\\\r\\\\nan effort, the economic parameters of electronic service compared to\\\\r\\\\ntraditional library operations, and the business and political factors\\\\r\\\\naffecting the shift from print distribution to electronic networked\\\\r\\\\naccess.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe strategic plan envisions a combination of publicly searchable access\\\\r\\\\ndatabases, image (and text) document collections stored on network \"file\\\\r\\\\nservers,\" local and remote network access, and an intellectual property\\\\r\\\\nmanagement-control system.  This combination of technology and\\\\r\\\\ninformation content is defined in this plan as an E-library or E-library\\\\r\\\\ncollection.  Some participating sponsors are already developing projects\\\\r\\\\nbased on MemRI\\\\\\'s recommended directions.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe E-library strategy projected in this plan is a visionary one that can\\\\r\\\\nenable major changes and improvements in academic, public, and special\\\\r\\\\nlibrary service.  This vision is, though, one that can be realized with\\\\r\\\\ntoday\\\\\\'s technology.  At the same time, it will challenge the political\\\\r\\\\nand social structure within which libraries operate:  in academic\\\\r\\\\nlibraries, the traditional emphasis on local collections, extending to\\\\r\\\\naccreditation issues; in public libraries, the potential of electronic\\\\r\\\\nbranch and central libraries fully available to the public; and for\\\\r\\\\nspecial libraries, new opportunities for shared collections and networks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe environment in which this strategic plan has been developed is, at\\\\r\\\\nthe moment, dominated by a sense of library limits.  The continued\\\\r\\\\nexpansion and rapid growth of local academic library collections is now\\\\r\\\\nclearly at an end.  Corporate libraries, and even law libraries, are\\\\r\\\\nfaced with operating within a difficult economic climate, as well as with\\\\r\\\\nvery active competition from commercial information sources.  For\\\\r\\\\nexample, public libraries may be seen as a desirable but not critical\\\\r\\\\nmunicipal service in a time when the budgets of safety and health\\\\r\\\\nagencies are being cut back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFurther, libraries in general have a very high labor-to-cost ratio in\\\\r\\\\ntheir budgets, and labor costs are still increasing, notwithstanding\\\\r\\\\nautomation investments.  It is difficult for libraries to obtain capital,\\\\r\\\\nstartup, or seed funding for innovative activities, and those\\\\r\\\\ntechnology-intensive initiatives that offer the potential of decreased\\\\r\\\\nlabor costs can provoke the opposition of library staff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHowever, libraries have achieved some considerable successes in the past\\\\r\\\\ntwo decades by improving both their service and their credibility within\\\\r\\\\ntheir organizations--and these positive changes have been accomplished\\\\r\\\\nmostly with judicious use of information technologies.  The advances in\\\\r\\\\ncomputing and information technology have been well-chronicled:  the\\\\r\\\\ncontinuing precipitous drop in computing costs, the growth of the\\\\r\\\\nInternet and private networks, and the explosive increase in publicly\\\\r\\\\navailable information databases.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor example, OCLC has become one of the largest computer network\\\\r\\\\norganizations in the world by creating a cooperative cataloging network\\\\r\\\\nof more than 6,000 libraries worldwide.  On-line public access catalogs\\\\r\\\\nnow serve millions of users on more than 50,000 dedicated terminals in\\\\r\\\\nthe United States alone.  The University of California MELVYL on-line\\\\r\\\\ncatalog system has now expanded into an index database reference service\\\\r\\\\nand supports more than six million searches a year.  And, libraries have\\\\r\\\\nbecome the largest group of customers of CD-ROM publishing technology;\\\\r\\\\nmore than 30,000 optical media publications such as those offered by\\\\r\\\\nInfoTrac and Silver Platter are subscribed to by U.S. libraries.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis march of technology continues and in the next decade will result in\\\\r\\\\nfurther innovations that are extremely difficult to predict.  What is\\\\r\\\\nclear is that libraries can now go beyond automation of their order files\\\\r\\\\nand catalogs to automation of their collections themselves--and it is\\\\r\\\\npossible to circumvent the fiscal limitations that appear to obtain\\\\r\\\\ntoday.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis Electronic Library Strategic Plan recommends a paradigm shift in\\\\r\\\\nlibrary service, and demonstrates the steps necessary to provide improved\\\\r\\\\nlibrary services with limited capacities and operating investments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION IV-A\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnne KENNEY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Cornell/Xerox Joint Study in Digital Preservation resulted in the\\\\r\\\\nrecording of 1,000 brittle books as 600-dpi digital images and the\\\\r\\\\nproduction, on demand, of high-quality and archivally sound paper\\\\r\\\\nreplacements.  The project, which was supported by the Commission on\\\\r\\\\nPreservation and Access, also investigated some of the issues surrounding\\\\r\\\\nscanning, storing, retrieving, and providing access to digital images in\\\\r\\\\na network environment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnne Kenney will focus on some of the issues surrounding direct scanning\\\\r\\\\nas identified in the Cornell Xerox Project.  Among those to be discussed\\\\r\\\\nare:  image versus text capture; indexing and access; image-capture\\\\r\\\\ncapabilities; a comparison to photocopy and microfilm; production and\\\\r\\\\ncost analysis; storage formats, protocols, and standards; and the use of\\\\r\\\\nthis scanning technology for preservation purposes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe 600-dpi digital images produced in the Cornell Xerox Project proved\\\\r\\\\nhighly acceptable for creating paper replacements of deteriorating\\\\r\\\\noriginals.  The 1,000 scanned volumes provided an array of image-capture\\\\r\\\\nchallenges that are common to nineteenth-century printing techniques and\\\\r\\\\nembrittled material, and that defy the use of text-conversion processes.\\\\r\\\\nThese challenges include diminished contrast between text and background,\\\\r\\\\nfragile and deteriorated pages, uneven printing, elaborate type faces,\\\\r\\\\nfaint and bold text adjacency, handwritten text and annotations, nonRoman\\\\r\\\\nlanguages, and a proliferation of illustrated material embedded in text.\\\\r\\\\nThe latter category included high-frequency and low-frequency halftones,\\\\r\\\\ncontinuous tone photographs, intricate mathematical drawings, maps,\\\\r\\\\netchings, reverse-polarity drawings, and engravings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Xerox prototype scanning system provided a number of important\\\\r\\\\nfeatures for capturing this diverse material.  Technicians used multiple\\\\r\\\\nthreshold settings, filters, line art and halftone definitions,\\\\r\\\\nautosegmentation, windowing, and software-editing programs to optimize\\\\r\\\\nimage capture.  At the same time, this project focused on production.\\\\r\\\\nThe goal was to make scanning as affordable and acceptable as\\\\r\\\\nphotocopying and microfilming for preservation reformatting.  A\\\\r\\\\ntime-and-cost study conducted during the last three months of this\\\\r\\\\nproject confirmed the economic viability of digital scanning, and these\\\\r\\\\nfindings will be discussed here.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom the outset, the Cornell Xerox Project was predicated on the use of\\\\r\\\\nnonproprietary standards and the use of common protocols when standards\\\\r\\\\ndid not exist.  Digital files were created as TIFF images which were\\\\r\\\\ncompressed prior to storage using Group 4 CCITT compression.  The Xerox\\\\r\\\\nsoftware is MS DOS based and utilizes off-the shelf programs such as\\\\r\\\\nMicrosoft Windows and Wang Image Wizard.  The digital library is designed\\\\r\\\\nto be hardware-independent and to provide interchangeability with other\\\\r\\\\ninstitutions through network connections.  Access to the digital files\\\\r\\\\nthemselves is two-tiered:  Bibliographic records for the computer files\\\\r\\\\nare created in RLIN and Cornell\\\\\\'s local system and access into the actual\\\\r\\\\ndigital images comprising a book is provided through a document control\\\\r\\\\nstructure and a networked image file-server, both of which will be\\\\r\\\\ndescribed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe presentation will conclude with a discussion of some of the issues\\\\r\\\\nsurrounding the use of this technology as a preservation tool (storage,\\\\r\\\\nrefreshing, backup).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe National Agricultural Library (NAL) has had extensive experience with\\\\r\\\\nraster scanning of printed materials.  Since 1987, the Library has\\\\r\\\\nparticipated in the National Agricultural Text Digitizing Project (NATDP)\\\\r\\\\na cooperative effort between NAL and forty-five land grant university\\\\r\\\\nlibraries.  An overview of the project will be presented, giving its\\\\r\\\\nhistory and NAL\\\\\\'s strategy for the future.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn in-depth discussion of NATDP will follow, including a description of\\\\r\\\\nthe scanning process, from the gathering of the printed materials to the\\\\r\\\\narchiving of the electronic pages.  The type of equipment required for a\\\\r\\\\nstand-alone scanning workstation and the importance of file management\\\\r\\\\nsoftware will be discussed.  Issues concerning the images themselves will\\\\r\\\\nbe addressed briefly, such as image format; black and white versus color;\\\\r\\\\ngray scale versus dithering; and resolution.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso described will be a study currently in progress by NAL to evaluate\\\\r\\\\nthe usefulness of converting microfilm to electronic images in order to\\\\r\\\\nimprove access.  With the cooperation of Tuskegee University, NAL has\\\\r\\\\nselected three reels of microfilm from a collection of sixty-seven reels\\\\r\\\\ncontaining the papers, letters, and drawings of George Washington Carver.\\\\r\\\\nThe three reels were converted into 3,500 electronic images using a\\\\r\\\\nspecialized microfilm scanner.  The selection, filming, and indexing of\\\\r\\\\nthis material will be discussed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDonald WATERS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Open Book, the Yale University Library\\\\\\'s effort to convert 10,\\\\r\\\\n000 books from microfilm to digital imagery, is currently in an advanced\\\\r\\\\nstate of planning and organization.  The Yale Library has selected a\\\\r\\\\nmajor vendor to serve as a partner in the project and as systems\\\\r\\\\nintegrator.  In its proposal, the successful vendor helped isolate areas\\\\r\\\\nof risk and uncertainty as well as key issues to be addressed during the\\\\r\\\\nlife of the project.  The Yale Library is now poised to decide what\\\\r\\\\nmaterial it will convert to digital image form and to seek funding,\\\\r\\\\ninitially for the first phase and then for the entire project.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe proposal that Yale accepted for the implementation of Project Open\\\\r\\\\nBook will provide at the end of three phases a conversion subsystem,\\\\r\\\\nbrowsing stations distributed on the campus network within the Yale\\\\r\\\\nLibrary, a subsystem for storing 10,000 books at 200 and 600 dots per\\\\r\\\\ninch, and network access to the image printers.  Pricing for the system\\\\r\\\\nimplementation assumes the existence of Yale\\\\\\'s campus ethernet network\\\\r\\\\nand its high-speed image printers, and includes other requisite hardware\\\\r\\\\nand software, as well as system integration services.  Proposed operating\\\\r\\\\ncosts include hardware and software maintenance, but do not include\\\\r\\\\nestimates for the facilities management of the storage devices and image\\\\r\\\\nservers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYale selected its vendor partner in a formal process, partly funded by\\\\r\\\\nthe Commission for Preservation and Access.  Following a request for\\\\r\\\\nproposal, the Yale Library selected two vendors as finalists to work with\\\\r\\\\nYale staff to generate a detailed analysis of requirements for Project\\\\r\\\\nOpen Book.  Each vendor used the results of the requirements analysis to\\\\r\\\\ngenerate and submit a formal proposal for the entire project.  This\\\\r\\\\ncompetitive process not only enabled the Yale Library to select its\\\\r\\\\nprimary vendor partner but also revealed much about the state of the\\\\r\\\\nimaging industry, about the varying, corporate commitments to the markets\\\\r\\\\nfor imaging technology, and about the varying organizational dynamics\\\\r\\\\nthrough which major companies are responding to and seeking to develop\\\\r\\\\nthese markets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Open Book is focused specifically on the conversion of images\\\\r\\\\nfrom microfilm to digital form.  The technology for scanning microfilm is\\\\r\\\\nreadily available but is changing rapidly.  In its project requirements,\\\\r\\\\nthe Yale Library emphasized features of the technology that affect the\\\\r\\\\ntechnical quality of digital image production and the costs of creating\\\\r\\\\nand storing the image library:  What levels of digital resolution can be\\\\r\\\\nachieved by scanning microfilm?  How does variation in the quality of\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm, particularly in film produced to preservation standards,\\\\r\\\\naffect the quality of the digital images?  What technologies can an\\\\r\\\\noperator effectively and economically apply when scanning film to\\\\r\\\\nseparate two-up images and to control for and correct image\\\\r\\\\nimperfections?  How can quality control best be integrated into\\\\r\\\\ndigitizing work flow that includes document indexing and storage?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe actual and expected uses of digital images--storage, browsing,\\\\r\\\\nprinting, and OCR--help determine the standards for measuring their\\\\r\\\\nquality.  Browsing is especially important, but the facilities available\\\\r\\\\nfor readers to browse image documents is perhaps the weakest aspect of\\\\r\\\\nimaging technology and most in need of development.  As it defined its\\\\r\\\\nrequirements, the Yale Library concentrated on some fundamental aspects\\\\r\\\\nof usability for image documents:  Does the system have sufficient\\\\r\\\\nflexibility to handle the full range of document types, including\\\\r\\\\nmonographs, multi-part and multivolume sets, and serials, as well as\\\\r\\\\nmanuscript collections?  What conventions are necessary to identify a\\\\r\\\\ndocument uniquely for storage and retrieval?  Where is the database of\\\\r\\\\nrecord for storing bibliographic information about the image document?\\\\r\\\\nHow are basic internal structures of documents, such as pagination, made\\\\r\\\\naccessible to the reader?  How are the image documents physically\\\\r\\\\npresented on the screen to the reader?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Yale Library designed Project Open Book on the assumption that\\\\r\\\\nmicrofilm is more than adequate as a medium for preserving the content of\\\\r\\\\ndeteriorated library materials.  As planning in the project has advanced,\\\\r\\\\nit is increasingly clear that the challenge of digital image technology\\\\r\\\\nand the key to the success of efforts like Project Open Book is to\\\\r\\\\nprovide a means of both preserving and improving access to those\\\\r\\\\ndeteriorated materials.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION IV-B\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGeorge THOMA\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the use of electronic imaging for document preservation, there are\\\\r\\\\nseveral issues to consider, such as:  ensuring adequate image quality,\\\\r\\\\nmaintaining substantial conversion rates (through-put), providing unique\\\\r\\\\nidentification for automated access and retrieval, and accommodating\\\\r\\\\nbound volumes and fragile material.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo maintain high image quality, image processing functions are required\\\\r\\\\nto correct the deficiencies in the scanned image.  Some commercially\\\\r\\\\navailable systems include these functions, while some do not.  The\\\\r\\\\nscanned raw image must be processed to correct contrast deficiencies--\\\\r\\\\nboth poor overall contrast resulting from light print and/or dark\\\\r\\\\nbackground, and variable contrast resulting from stains and\\\\r\\\\nbleed-through.  Furthermore, the scan density must be adequate to allow\\\\r\\\\nlegibility of print and sufficient fidelity in the pseudo-halftoned gray\\\\r\\\\nmaterial.  Borders or page-edge effects must be removed for both\\\\r\\\\ncompactibility and aesthetics.  Page skew must be corrected for aesthetic\\\\r\\\\nreasons and to enable accurate character recognition if desired.\\\\r\\\\nCompound images consisting of both two-toned text and gray-scale\\\\r\\\\nillustrations must be processed appropriately to retain the quality of\\\\r\\\\neach.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION IV-C\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJean BARONAS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStandards publications being developed by scientists, engineers, and\\\\r\\\\nbusiness managers in Association for Information and Image Management\\\\r\\\\n(AIIM) standards committees can be applied to electronic image management\\\\r\\\\n(EIM) processes including:  document (image) transfer, retrieval and\\\\r\\\\nevaluation; optical disk and document scanning; and document design and\\\\r\\\\nconversion.  When combined with EIM system planning and operations,\\\\r\\\\nstandards can assist in generating image databases that are\\\\r\\\\ninterchangeable among a variety of systems.  The applications of\\\\r\\\\ndifferent approaches for image-tagging, indexing, compression, and\\\\r\\\\ntransfer often cause uncertainty concerning EIM system compatibility,\\\\r\\\\ncalibration, performance, and upward compatibility, until standard\\\\r\\\\nimplementation parameters are established.  The AIIM standards that are\\\\r\\\\nbeing developed for these applications can be used to decrease the\\\\r\\\\nuncertainty, successfully integrate imaging processes, and promote \"open\\\\r\\\\nsystems.\"  AIIM is an accredited American National Standards Institute\\\\r\\\\n(ANSI) standards developer with more than twenty committees comprised of\\\\r\\\\n300 volunteers representing users, vendors, and manufacturers.  The\\\\r\\\\nstandards publications that are developed in these committees have\\\\r\\\\nnational acceptance and provide the basis for international harmonization\\\\r\\\\nin the development of new International Organization for Standardization\\\\r\\\\n(ISO) standards.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis presentation describes the development of AIIM\\\\\\'s EIM standards and a\\\\r\\\\nnew effort at AIIM, a database on standards projects in a wide framework\\\\r\\\\nof imaging industries including capture, recording, processing,\\\\r\\\\nduplication, distribution, display, evaluation, and preservation.  The\\\\r\\\\nAIIM Imagery Database will cover imaging standards being developed by\\\\r\\\\nmany organizations in many different countries.  It will contain\\\\r\\\\nstandards publications\\\\\\' dates, origins, related national and\\\\r\\\\ninternational projects, status, key words, and abstracts.  The ANSI Image\\\\r\\\\nTechnology Standards Board requested that such a database be established,\\\\r\\\\nas did the ISO/International Electrotechnical Commission Joint Task Force\\\\r\\\\non Imagery.  AIIM will take on the leadership role for the database and\\\\r\\\\ncoordinate its development with several standards developers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPatricia BATTIN\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     Characteristics of standards for digital imagery:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          * Nature of digital technology implies continuing volatility.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          * Precipitous standard-setting not possible and probably not\\\\r\\\\n          desirable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          * Standards are a complex issue involving the medium, the\\\\r\\\\n          hardware, the software, and the technical capacity for\\\\r\\\\n          reproductive fidelity and clarity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          * The prognosis for reliable archival standards (as defined by\\\\r\\\\n          librarians) in the foreseeable future is poor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     Significant potential and attractiveness of digital technology as a\\\\r\\\\n     preservation medium and access mechanism.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     Productive use of digital imagery for preservation requires a\\\\r\\\\n     reconceptualizing of preservation principles in a volatile,\\\\r\\\\n     standardless world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     Concept of managing continuing access in the digital environment\\\\r\\\\n     rather than focusing on the permanence of the medium and long-term\\\\r\\\\n     archival standards developed for the analog world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     Transition period:  How long and what to do?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          *  Redefine \"archival.\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          *  Remove the burden of \"archival copy\" from paper artifacts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          *  Use digital technology for storage, develop management\\\\r\\\\n          strategies for refreshing medium, hardware and software.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n          *  Create acid-free paper copies for transition period backup\\\\r\\\\n          until we develop reliable procedures for ensuring continuing\\\\r\\\\n          access to digital files.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION IV-D\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStuart WEIBEL            The Role of SGML Markup in the CORE Project (6)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks as a basic\\\\r\\\\nfeature of the scholarly workplace is driving the demand for electronic\\\\r\\\\ndocument delivery.  Three distinct categories of electronic\\\\r\\\\npublishing/republishing are necessary to support access demands in this\\\\r\\\\nemerging environment:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     1.)  Conversion of paper or microfilm archives to electronic format\\\\r\\\\n     2.)  Conversion of electronic files to formats tailored to\\\\r\\\\n          electronic retrieval and display\\\\r\\\\n     3.)  Primary electronic publishing (materials for which the\\\\r\\\\n          electronic version is the primary format)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOCLC has experimental or product development activities in each of these\\\\r\\\\nareas.  Among the challenges that lie ahead is the integration of these\\\\r\\\\nthree types of information stores in coherent distributed systems.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe CORE (Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment) Project is a model for\\\\r\\\\nthe conversion of large text and graphics collections for which\\\\r\\\\nelectronic typesetting files are available (category 2).  The American\\\\r\\\\nChemical Society has made available computer typography files dating from\\\\r\\\\n1980 for its twenty journals.  This collection of some 250 journal-years\\\\r\\\\nis being converted to an electronic format that will be accessible\\\\r\\\\nthrough several end-user applications.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe use of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) offers the means\\\\r\\\\nto capture the structural richness of the original articles in a way that\\\\r\\\\nwill support a variety of retrieval, navigation, and display options\\\\r\\\\nnecessary to navigate effectively in very large text databases.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn SGML document consists of text that is marked up with descriptive tags\\\\r\\\\nthat specify the function of a given element within the document.  As a\\\\r\\\\nformal language construct, an SGML document can be parsed against a\\\\r\\\\ndocument-type definition (DTD) that unambiguously defines what elements\\\\r\\\\nare allowed and where in the document they can (or must) occur.  This\\\\r\\\\nformalized map of article structure allows the user interface design to\\\\r\\\\nbe uncoupled from the underlying database system, an important step\\\\r\\\\ntoward interoperability.  Demonstration of this separability is a part of\\\\r\\\\nthe CORE project, wherein user interface designs born of very different\\\\r\\\\nphilosophies will access the same database.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNOTES:\\\\r\\\\n     (6)  The CORE project is a collaboration among Cornell University\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\n     Mann Library, Bell Communications Research (Bellcore), the American\\\\r\\\\n     Chemical Society (ACS), the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), and\\\\r\\\\n     OCLC.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMichael LESK                  The CORE Electronic Chemistry Library\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA major on-line file of chemical journal literature complete with\\\\r\\\\ngraphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic\\\\r\\\\naccess to documents, as a joint project of Cornell University, the\\\\r\\\\nAmerican Chemical Society, the Chemical Abstracts Service, OCLC, and\\\\r\\\\nBellcore (with additional support from Sun Microsystems, Springer-Verlag,\\\\r\\\\nDigitaI Equipment Corporation, Sony Corporation of America, and Apple\\\\r\\\\nComputers).  Our file contains the American Chemical Society\\\\\\'s on-line\\\\r\\\\njournals, supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication.  The\\\\r\\\\nindexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts Documents is available\\\\r\\\\nin both image and text format, and several different interfaces can be\\\\r\\\\nused.  Our goals are (1) to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic access to primary journals as compared with paper, and (2) to\\\\r\\\\nidentify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an\\\\r\\\\nelectronic system of journals, including in particular a comparison of\\\\r\\\\npage-image display with ASCII display interfaces.  Early experiments with\\\\r\\\\nchemistry students on a variety of tasks suggest that searching tasks are\\\\r\\\\ncompleted much faster with any electronic system than with paper, but\\\\r\\\\nthat for reading all versions of the articles are roughly equivalent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nText conversion is far more expensive and time-consuming than image\\\\r\\\\ncapture alone.  NAL\\\\\\'s experience with optical character recognition (OCR)\\\\r\\\\nwill be related and compared with the experience of having text rekeyed.\\\\r\\\\nWhat factors affect OCR accuracy?  How accurate does full text have to be\\\\r\\\\nin order to be useful?  How do different users react to imperfect text?\\\\r\\\\nThese are questions that will be explored.  For many, a service bureau\\\\r\\\\nmay be a better solution than performing the work inhouse; this will also\\\\r\\\\nbe discussed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSESSION VI\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMarybeth PETERS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCopyright law protects creative works.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\\\r\\\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\\\r\\\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\\\r\\\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\\\r\\\\npeople in all walks of life.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\\\r\\\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\\\r\\\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\\\r\\\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\\\r\\\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\\\r\\\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\\\r\\\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSection 3.

The Foundation\\\\\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\\\r\\\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\\\r\\\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\\\r\\\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\\\r\\\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\\\\\'s laws.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Foundation\\\\\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\\\r\\\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\\\r\\\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\\\r\\\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\\\r\\\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\\\r\\\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\\\r\\\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\\\r\\\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\\\r\\\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\\\r\\\\nstatus with the IRS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\\\r\\\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\\\r\\\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\\\r\\\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\\\r\\\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\\\r\\\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\\\r\\\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\\\r\\\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\\\r\\\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\\\r\\\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\\\r\\\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\\\r\\\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\\\r\\\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\\\r\\\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\\\r\\\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\\\r\\\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\\\r\\\\nworks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\\\r\\\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\\\r\\\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\\\r\\\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\\\r\\\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\\\r\\\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\\\r\\\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\\\r\\\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\\\r\\\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\\\r\\\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\\\r\\\\n\\''"
